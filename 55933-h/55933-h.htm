<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Dramatic Dialogue</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, this is no surprise to us,&rdquo; Thomas Lane
said to his daughter Peggy, who perched tensely on
the edge of a kitchen stool. &ldquo;We could hardly have
helped knowing that you&rsquo;ve wanted to be an actress
since you were out of your cradle. It&rsquo;s just that decisions
like this can&rsquo;t be made quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad!&rdquo; Peggy almost wailed. &ldquo;You just finished
saying yourself that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about
this and wanting it for years! You can&rsquo;t follow that by
calling it a quick decision!&rdquo; She turned to her mother,
her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut
curls. &ldquo;Mother, you understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white
hand on her daughter&rsquo;s lean brown one. &ldquo;Of course
I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We
both want to do what&rsquo;s best for you, not to stand in
your way. The only question is whether the time is
right, or if you should wait longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Mother&mdash;Dad&mdash;I&rsquo;m years behind already!
The theater is full of beginners a year and even two
years younger than I am, and girls of my age have
lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to
wait for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s father put down his coffee cup and leaned
back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs
against the wall behind him. He took his time before
answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was
warm and slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peg, I don&rsquo;t want to hold up your career. I don&rsquo;t
have any objections to your wanting to act. I think&mdash;judging
from the plays I&rsquo;ve seen you in at high
school and college&mdash;that you have a real talent. But
I thought that if you would go on with college for
three more years and get your degree, you would
gain so much worth-while knowledge that you&rsquo;d use
and enjoy for the rest of your life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not acting knowledge!&rdquo; Peggy cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to life than that,&rdquo; her father put in.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s history and literature and foreign languages
and mathematics and sciences and music and art
and philosophy and a lot more&mdash;all of them fascinating
and all important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them is as fascinating as acting to me,&rdquo;
Peggy replied, &ldquo;and none of them is nearly as important
to my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Mrs. Lane nodded. &ldquo;Of course, dear. I know just
how you feel about it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would have answered
just the same way when I was your age, except
that for me it was singing instead of acting. But&mdash;&rdquo; and
here her pleasant face betrayed a trace of
sadness&mdash;&ldquo;but I was never able to be a singer. I guess
I wasn&rsquo;t quite good enough or else I didn&rsquo;t really
want it hard enough&mdash;to go on with all the study and
practice it needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter&rsquo;s
intense expression, then took a deep breath before
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you must realize, Margaret, is that you may
not quite make the grade. We think you&rsquo;re wonderful,
but the theater is full of young girls whose parents
thought they were the most talented things
alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school
and college plays; girls who have everything
except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you
are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you
to have something to fall back on, just in case
you ever need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy&rsquo;s hurt look, was quick to
step in with reassurance. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going
to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and
your talents. I don&rsquo;t see how you could miss being the
biggest success ever&mdash;but I&rsquo;m your father, not a
Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be
wrong. And if I am wrong, I don&rsquo;t want you to be
hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a
teacher&rsquo;s certificate so that you can always find
useful work if you have to. Then you can try your
luck in the theater. Doesn&rsquo;t that make sense?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for
a few moments before answering. Then, looking first
at her mother and then at her father, she replied
firmly, &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t! It might make sense if we
were talking about anything else but acting, but
we&rsquo;re not. If I&rsquo;m ever going to try, I&rsquo;ll have a better
chance now than I will in three years. But I can see
your point of view, Dad, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
make a bargain with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of bargain, Peg?&rdquo; her father asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you let me go to New York now, and if I can get
into a good drama school there, I&rsquo;ll study and try to
find acting jobs at the same time. That way I&rsquo;ll still be
going to school and I&rsquo;ll be giving myself a chance.
And if I&rsquo;m not started in a career in one year, I&rsquo;ll go
back to college and get my teacher&rsquo;s certificate before
I try the theater again. How does that sound to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds fair enough,&rdquo; Tom Lane admitted, &ldquo;but
are you so confident that you&rsquo;ll see results in one
year? After all, some of our top stars worked many
times that long before getting any recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect recognition in one year, Dad,&rdquo;
Peggy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that conceited or that silly. All
I hope is that I&rsquo;ll be able to get a part in that time,
and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.
And that&rsquo;s probably asking too much. If I have to,
I&rsquo;ll make a living at something else, maybe working
in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What
I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can&rsquo;t,
I&rsquo;ll come home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty
good idea of what she&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said. &ldquo;She
sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed
and expected to see her name in lights in a few
weeks, I&rsquo;d vote against her going, but I&rsquo;m beginning
to think that maybe she&rsquo;s right about this being the
best time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother!&rdquo; Peggy shouted, jumping down from
the stool and throwing her arms about her mother&rsquo;s
neck. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d understand! And you understand
too, don&rsquo;t you, Dad?&rdquo; she appealed.</p>
<p>Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his
pipe to get it started. &ldquo;I ... never said ... I didn&rsquo;t
... understand you ... did I?&rdquo; His pipe satisfactorily
sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he
took it out of his mouth before continuing more
evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peg, your mother and I are cautious only because
we love you so much and want what&rsquo;s going to make
you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you
any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,
I&rsquo;m not a complete stranger to show business.
Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the <i>Eagle</i>,
I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in
New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and
actresses ... and I know how hard the city often
was for them. But I don&rsquo;t want to protect you from
life. That&rsquo;s no good either. Just let me think about it
a little longer and let me talk to your mother some
more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Mrs. Lane patted Peggy&rsquo;s arm and said, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don&rsquo;t you go
out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation
quietly? We&rsquo;ll decide before bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen
door, where she paused to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going out to
the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then
maybe I&rsquo;ll go down to Jean&rsquo;s for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she
turned to look back just in time to see her mother
throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.
Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind
her and started for the barn.</p>
<p>Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had
been Peggy&rsquo;s favorite place to go to be by herself and
think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses
and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing
in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to
Socks&rsquo;s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,
she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.
Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall
among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of
sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks&rsquo;s silky
nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.
Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against
Peggy&rsquo;s hand in appreciation.</p>
<p>As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet
and checked to see that there was enough straw in
the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and
the new life that she might soon be going to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a
small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And
not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people
supported good schools, an excellent library, and two
good movie houses. What&rsquo;s more, the Rockport Community
College attracted theater groups and concert
artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.
And of course, all of this was in addition to the
usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,
movie dates, and formal dances&mdash;everything that a
girl could want.</p>
<p>Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded
street, every country road, field, lake, and
stream. All of her friends were here, friends she had
known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard
to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in
her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then
as soon as she possibly could.</p>
<p>It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her
friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave
Rockport. She was not running away from anything,
she reminded herself; she was running <i>to</i> something.</p>
<p>To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering
towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?
Would it really be like that? Or would it be something
different, something like the dreary side-street
world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in
movies?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going
from office to office looking for a part in a play,
Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself
back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,
soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around
the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the
horse&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socks,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I need some of your horse
sense if I&rsquo;m going to go out on my own! We&rsquo;ll go
for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air
won&rsquo;t clear my silly mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,
stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was
still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents
had reached a decision about her future. Fighting
down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to
see how they were coming along, Peggy continued
down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk
past the front porch of her family&rsquo;s old farmhouse
and down the street toward Jean Wilson&rsquo;s
house at the end of the block.</p>
<p>As she walked by her own home, she noticed with
a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on
the front lawn broke up the light from the windows
behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,
or maybe a little more, she wondered why she
wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be
better?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Dramatic Decision</i></span></h2>
<p>Upstairs at the Wilsons&rsquo;, Peggy found Jean swathed
in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,
which was now white with lather and piled up in a
high, soapy knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just washed it yesterday!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Are
you doing it again&mdash;or still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.
&ldquo;Again, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
a nervous habit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re not bald, with all the rubbing
you give your hair,&rdquo; Peggy said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a
clean scalp!&rdquo; Jean answered with a humorous crinkle
of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing
out her cheeks comically, she plunged her head
into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo
hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet
hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled
another dry towel around her head like an Indian
turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,
tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the
steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,
bedroom. When they had made themselves
comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came
straight to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the grand debate is still going on, is it? When
do you think they&rsquo;ll make up their minds?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they haven&rsquo;t decided anything
yet?&rdquo; Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that didn&rsquo;t take much deduction, my dear
Watson,&rdquo; Jean laughed. &ldquo;If they had decided against
the New York trip, your face would be as long as
Socks&rsquo;s nose, and it&rsquo;s not half that long. And if the answer
was yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait to hear about it!
You would have been flying around the room and
talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was
decided yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, if I were as smart as you,&rdquo; Peggy said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;I would have figured out a way to convince
Mother and Dad by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t feel bad about being dumb,&rdquo; Jean said in
mock tones of comfort. &ldquo;If I were as pretty and talented
as you are, I wouldn&rsquo;t need brains, either!&rdquo;
With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on
the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at
her.</p>
<p>A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving
the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to
retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on
the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I sometimes think that we haven&rsquo;t
grown up at all!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can hardly blame my
parents for thinking twice&mdash;and a lot more&mdash;before
treating me like an adult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Jean replied firmly. &ldquo;Your parents
know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with
being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I
know that they&rsquo;re not the least bit worried about your
being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking
with my folks last night, and they haven&rsquo;t got a
doubt in the world about you. But they know how
hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they
want to be sure that you have a profession in case
you don&rsquo;t get a break in show business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;We had a long talk
about it this evening after dinner.&rdquo; Then she told her
friend about the conversation and her proposed &ldquo;bargain&rdquo;
with her parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both seemed to think it was fair,&rdquo; she concluded,
&ldquo;and when I went out, they were talking it
over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and
I&rsquo;m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its
decision. You know,&rdquo; she said suddenly, sitting up
on the floor and crossing her legs under her, &ldquo;I bet
they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate a minute if you would only
change your mind and decide to come with me and
try it too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s thoughtful silence, Jean answered
slowly, &ldquo;No, Peg. I&rsquo;ve thought this all out before,
and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is
right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic
groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a
comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I
haven&rsquo;t got the real professional thing&mdash;and I know
that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I
think I do have for the theater is the ability to recognize
talent when I see it&mdash;and to recognize that it&rsquo;s
not there when it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jean,&rdquo; Peggy protested, &ldquo;you can handle
comedy and character lines as well as anyone I
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming
at the same time to brush it off. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t
matter. You know even better than I that there&rsquo;s a lot
more to being an actress&mdash;a successful one&mdash;than
reading lines well. There&rsquo;s the ability to make the
audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk
on, whether you have lines or not. And that&rsquo;s something
you can&rsquo;t learn; you either have it, or you
don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s like being double-jointed. I can make an
audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can
make them look at you and respond to you and be
with you all the way, even with bad lines. That&rsquo;s
why you&rsquo;re going to go to New York and be an actress.
And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jean&mdash;&rdquo; Peggy began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;No buts!&rdquo; Jean cut in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked about this
enough before, and I&rsquo;m not going to change my
mind. I&rsquo;m as sure about what I want as you are about
what you want. I&rsquo;m going to finish college and get my
certificate as an English teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about acting? Can you get it out of
your mind as easily as all that?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dark and devious part of my plan,&rdquo;
Jean answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in
a comic witch&rsquo;s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look
that was completely out of place on her round,
freckled face. &ldquo;Once I get into a high school as an
English teacher, I&rsquo;m going to try to teach a special
course in the literature of the theater and maybe another
one in stagecraft. I&rsquo;m going to work with the
high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,
I&rsquo;ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of
recognizing talent. And that way,&rdquo; she added, becoming
much more serious, &ldquo;I have a chance really to
do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage
one or two people with real talent like yours,
then I&rsquo;ll feel that I&rsquo;ve really done something worth
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to
speak for fear of saying something foolishly sentimental,
or even of crying. Her friend&rsquo;s earnestness about
the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy&rsquo;s
talent had touched her more than she could say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long
time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and
flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind
her back. Running out of the bedroom, she
called, &ldquo;Come on! I&rsquo;ll race you down to the kitchen
for cocoa! By the time we&rsquo;re finished, it&rsquo;ll be about
time for your big Hour of Decision scene!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when Peggy finally felt
that her parents had had enough time to talk things
out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly
despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her
mother and father every minute she could. Reaching
her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac
bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that
fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she
heard her father&rsquo;s voice raised a little above its normal
soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the
words.</p>
<p>Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him
through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,
and now she caught his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Yes.... Yes&mdash;I think we can. Very
well, day after tomorrow, then. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;all
three of us. And, May&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be good to see you again,
after all these years! Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Peggy entered the room, her father put down
the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. &ldquo;Well, Betty,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all set, Dad?&rdquo; Peggy said, breaking into a
run to her father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all set, Peg,&rdquo; her father said with a
grin. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s set just the way you wanted it! There&rsquo;s
not a man in the world who can hold out against
two determined women.&rdquo; He leaned back against the
fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt
sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just
stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked
carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,
to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for goodness&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; her mother cried.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When
her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones
higher than usual. &ldquo;I ... I&rsquo;m trying to be sedate ... and
poised ... and very grown-up,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not easy. All I want to do is to&mdash;&rdquo; and she
jumped out of the chair&mdash;&ldquo;to yell <i>whoopee</i>!&rdquo; She
yelled at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,
Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the
favorite household conference room, for cookies and
milk and more talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me, Dad,&rdquo; Peggy asked, her mouth full
of oatmeal cookies, no longer &ldquo;sedate&rdquo; or &ldquo;poised,&rdquo;
but her natural, bubbling self. &ldquo;Who was that on the
phone, and where are the three of us going, and
what&rsquo;s all set?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing at a time,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;To begin
with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we
were going to let you go to New York to try a year&rsquo;s
experience in the theater. But then we had to decide
just where you would live, and where you should
study, and how much money you would need, and a
whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk
to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to
give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and
she&rsquo;s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was
a very successful actress. Now she&rsquo;s been retired for
some years, but I thought she might give us some
good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did she?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were luckier than I would have thought possible,&rdquo;
Mrs. Lane put in. &ldquo;It seems that May bought a
big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into
a rooming house especially for young actresses. She
always wanted a house of her own with a garden in
back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.
This way, she can afford to run a big place and at
the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says
she has a room that you can have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!&rdquo; Peggy exulted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,
and living with an experienced actress! I&rsquo;ll bet she
can teach me loads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she can,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;And so can
the New York Dramatic Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve managed to get me accepted
there! That&rsquo;s the best dramatic school in the country!
How&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too excited, Peg,&rdquo; Mr. Lane interrupted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not accepted anywhere yet, but May
Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place
to study acting, and she said she would set up an
audition for you in two days. The term starts in a
couple of weeks, so there isn&rsquo;t much time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days! Do you mean we&rsquo;ll be going to New
York day after tomorrow, just like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; her mother answered calmly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we
can get seats on. Your father doesn&rsquo;t believe in wasting
time, once his mind is made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo; Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe
what she had heard. &ldquo;What are we sitting here
talking for, then? I&rsquo;ve got a million things to do! I&rsquo;ve
got to get packed ... I&rsquo;ve got to think of what to
read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I
guess, but ... oh! I&rsquo;ll be terrible in a reading unless
I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts
will I do? Where&rsquo;s the Shakespeare? Where&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy&rsquo;s arm to
prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. &ldquo;Not
now, young lady! We&rsquo;ll pack in the morning, talk
about what you should read, and take an afternoon
plane to New York. But tonight, you&rsquo;d better think
of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to
be a busy time for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense
of what her father said. She finished her milk and
cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs
to bed.</p>
<p>But it was one thing to go to bed and another to
go to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and
the patterns of light and shade cast by the street
lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big
maple tree. As she watched the shifting shadows,
she reviewed the roles she had played since her first
time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh
herself on? Which ones would she do best? And
which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized
that she had grown and developed past some
of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited
to her talent and her appearance. But both had
changed. She was certainly not a mature actress
yet, from any point of view, but neither was she a
schoolgirl. Her trim figure was well formed; her face
had lost the undefined, simple cuteness of the early
teens, and had gained character. She didn&rsquo;t think she
should read a young romantic part like Juliet. Not
that she couldn&rsquo;t do it, but perhaps something
sharper was called for.</p>
<p>Perhaps Viola in <i>Twelfth Night</i>? Or perhaps not
Shakespeare at all. Maybe the people at the Academy
would think she was too arty or too pretentious?
Maybe she should do something dramatic and full of
stormy emotion, like Blanche in <i>A Streetcar Named
Desire</i>? Or, better for her development and age, a
light, brittle, comedy role...?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Nothing seemed quite right. Peggy&rsquo;s thoughts
shifted with the shadows overhead. All the plays she
had ever seen or read or acted in melted together in
a blur, until the characters from one seemed to be
talking with the characters from another and moving
about in an enormous set made of pieces from two or
three different plays. More actors kept coming on in
a fantastic assortment of costumes until the stage was
full. Then the stage lights dimmed, the actors joined
hands across the stage to bow, the curtain slowly
descended, the lights went out&mdash;and Peggy was fast
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>In the Wings</i></span></h2>
<p>When Peggy awoke in the early-morning sunshine
that slanted into her room, it was not yet six
o&rsquo;clock. She reached over to shut off the alarm so that
it would not ring at seven, the time she had decided
to get up for her big day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say that actors live in a dream world,&rdquo;
Peggy thought with a smile. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I
seem to want so little sleep. I get enough of dreams
when I&rsquo;m supposed to be wide awake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recognizing that it would be useless to try to doze
off again, she quickly slipped out of bed and quietly
set about her morning routine of washing and dressing.
The extra time gained by her early awakening
would give her an opportunity to select her reading
for the Academy, Peggy told herself as she stepped
into the shower. But first things first; before she could
think about the reading she would need a clear
mind, and that meant that all the many details of
packing and dressing must be taken care of. As she
wrapped herself in an oversized bath towel, Peggy
was already mentally choosing her clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>An hour and a half later, when Mr. and Mrs. Lane
came downstairs for breakfast, they discovered
Peggy, dressed and ready for the trip, sitting surrounded
by books at the big desk in the &ldquo;library&rdquo;
end of the living room. Her suitcase stood fully
packed in the front hall, a large traveling purse leaning
next to it like a puppy sleeping by its mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said. &ldquo;What did you do,
stay up all night? Why, you&rsquo;re ready to board the
plane this very minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite, Mother,&rdquo; Peggy answered with a smile.
&ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t settled on what to read tomorrow,
and I want to do that before I go. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll be
carting so many books with me to New York that
we&rsquo;ll have to pay a fortune in extra-baggage charges!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worried about you,&rdquo; her mother said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your mind made up and your part
memorized before we even leave, if I remember the
way you go at things! Now you can just put the books
away until after breakfast, because I&rsquo;m going to need
some help in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Peggy stood up, her mother looked approvingly
at the costume she had chosen for the flight. It was a
smart beige suit with a short jacket that was well cut
to accent Peggy&rsquo;s trim figure, and its tawny color was
the perfect complement for her even summer tan
and her dark chestnut hair. A simple pearl choker
and a pair of tiny pearl earrings provided just the
right amount of contrast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo; Peggy asked. Noting her mother&rsquo;s
admiring nod, she added, &ldquo;I packed my gray silk
suit and two dresses&mdash;the green print and the blue
dress-up, in case we go someplace. I mean someplace
dressy, for dinner or something. And I have the right
shoes packed, too, and stockings and blouses and
toothbrush and everything,&rdquo; she added, anticipating
her mother&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lane smiled and sighed. &ldquo;Well, I suppose
there&rsquo;s no use my pretending that you&rsquo;re not all
grown up and able to take care of yourself! You pass
inspection with flying colors! Now, let&rsquo;s get that
jacket off and get an apron on&mdash;we have some work
to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and her mother went into the kitchen to
prepare what Mr. Lane always called his &ldquo;traveling
breakfast,&rdquo; a huge repast of wheat cakes, eggs, sausages
and coffee, with plenty of orange juice to start,
maple syrup to soak the wheat cakes in, and more
coffee to finish up on. While breakfast was cooking,
Mr. Lane was on the phone, confirming their plane
reservations and, when this was done, arranging for
hotel rooms in New York. The last phone call was finished
barely a minute before the first steaming stack
of wheat cakes was set on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, sitting down to look with satisfaction
at his plate, &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s under control. We
leave at two this afternoon, which should have us in
New York by five. That gives us plenty of time. We&rsquo;ll
leave the house about one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time!&rdquo; Peggy wailed. &ldquo;What about my
reading? I&rsquo;ve got to get started right away!&rdquo; She gave
a fairly convincing performance of someone who
must get started right away, except for the fact that
she showed not the least sign of moving until she had
finished her breakfast.</p>
<p>During the meal, the talk was all of reservations,
changing planes at Chicago, what kind of rooms they
would have at the hotel, and all the many little details
of a trip, but Peggy hardly heard. She was still
sorting out plays and roles in her mind and trying to
make a decision.</p>
<p>By the second cup of coffee, her decision was
made. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; she announced in triumph and
relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prepare three short readings instead of
one long one! That&rsquo;ll give them a chance to see the
kinds of things I can do, and if I&rsquo;m bad in one, I&rsquo;ll
have two more chances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes sense,&rdquo; her father agreed. &ldquo;What three
parts do you think you&rsquo;ll try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not completely sure,&rdquo; Peggy said, &ldquo;but at
least I know what kinds of parts they&rsquo;ll be, and that
will make the job easier. One of them will surely
be Viola in <i>Twelfth Night</i> because I&rsquo;ve done it, and
I&rsquo;ve always felt that it was me, and besides, it&rsquo;s
Shakespeare, and I think I ought to have one Shakespeare
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good choice,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said. &ldquo;Now I
think you&rsquo;d better pick out one that&rsquo;s more dramatic
and another that&rsquo;s something of a comedy or
a character part, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I had in mind,&rdquo; Peggy answered.
&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to select, now that I know
what I&rsquo;m looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t easy, either. Peggy spent the whole
morning carefully looking over her collection of play
scripts. Every time she thought she had the right
role, she found there was no single scene that seemed
to be right for a short reading. There was no trouble
over Viola, because Shakespeare always wrote good
scenes and speeches, and because there was no need
to sketch in what had led up to the scene in the play,
since everyone was sure to be perfectly familiar with
it. But everything else seemed to be a problem. It was
not until her parents were all packed and there was
only half an hour before leaving, that she finally made
up her mind.</p>
<p>For the comedy reading, she determined to do Sabina
in the first scene of <i>Skin of our Teeth</i>, which had
much more to it than simple comedy. The business of
Sabina&rsquo;s stepping out of character to talk directly to
the audience as a disgusted actress criticizing the
play and its author gave added dimension to the
reading. For her dramatic role, Peggy chose the part
of Miriamne in the last scene of <i>Winterset</i>, a hauntingly
beautiful tragedy. She selected this, she explained
to her parents as they drove to the airport,
because it was one of the few dramatic, poetic parts
written for a girl of her own age, and she felt that she
could identify with the character. Then, book in
hand, she started to study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>They waited for the passenger call</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Peggy continued to read all through the arrival at
the airport, the business of checking in and loading
baggage. They waited for the passenger call, then
walked up the steps into the plane. When she was
settled in her seat by the window, she lowered her
book and turned, wide-eyed, to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said in slow, awed tones, &ldquo;that
this is my first time on an airplane, and I&rsquo;m just sitting
here reading?&rdquo; She closed the book on her lap.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just going to wait for a while, until I see
what&rsquo;s going on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out the oval window, she saw the steep
steps being wheeled away from the plane. A red fuel
truck drove under the wing and sped across the wide
concrete runway. Then the plane&rsquo;s engines whirled,
coughed once and started, and the plane lumbered
down the runway slowly. Reaching the end, it deliberately
turned, stopped for a moment, then suddenly
gathered up strength, leaped forward and sped into
the wind. Peggy watched, fascinated, as the ground
dropped away and the shadow of wings below grew
smaller and smaller as the plane rose. She watched
until the tiny farms, winding ribbons of highway, and
gleaming rivers disappeared beneath a puffy layer of
cloud. Then she looked back to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it looks as if my new career is
off to a flying start! Now I&rsquo;d better study these plays,
or I&rsquo;m in for an unhappy landing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Reluctantly tearing her eyes from the fantastic
cloud formations that floated past, Peggy once more
opened her book and was soon deep into the even
more fantastic world of Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <i>Skin of
Our Teeth</i>.</p>
<p>The quick flight to Chicago, the change of planes,
the landing and take-off, scarcely attracted her notice,
and the three hours flew by at faster than air
speed. Peggy had finished reading and marking Sabina&rsquo;s
role, and was deep into Miriamne&rsquo;s when her
mother interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want us to fasten our seat belts again,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming into New York now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Peggy noticed! Spread below her, stretching
out as if it would never end, was the maze of
streets and avenues, rivers and islands, towers and
bridges, that was the city of New York. The late afternoon
sun touched the windows of skyscrapers with
fire, gilded the steelwork of the bridges, cast deep,
black shadows into the streets and over the rooftops
of low buildings. Giant liners stood tied at docks;
others steamed sedately up or down the river, pushed
or pulled by tiny tugs. Even from their soaring height
above the scene, New York refused to look small or
toylike. It stubbornly looked only like the thing it was&mdash;the
busiest, tallest, most exciting city in the world!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Turning in a great, slow arc, the plane descended
until it was skimming only a few feet above the
waters of a broad bay. Peggy wondered if they had
flown in on a seaplane, and if they were to land in
the water and have to take a boat to shore, but even
as the thought occurred to her, the rocky shoreline
suddenly appeared beneath her, and the plane swiftly
settled down on the long, concrete runway of New
York&rsquo;s LaGuardia Airport.</p>
<p>It was the rush hour, and parkways and streets
were jammed with homebound cars, but their cab
driver knew his way around back streets, and turned
and twisted around one corner after another until
Peggy lost all sense of direction. Her father, though,
seemed to know exactly where they were at all times,
and kept pointing out buildings and parks and
bridges to Peggy and her mother, telling the name of
each and how it figured in his memory. People,
trucks, cars, buses, cabs, motor scooters and little foreign
autos filled the streets. Mr. Lane called out the
names of famous avenues as they came to and
crossed them: Park Avenue ... Madison Avenue
... Fifth Avenue....</p>
<p>The taxi passed by store after store, their windows
like so many stage sets. By the edge of Central
Park, they drew up in front of their hotel. Bewildered,
excited, dazzled, delighted, Peggy stepped out
of the taxi and stood for the first time on the sidewalks
of New York!</p>
<p class="tb">The temptation had been strong to give in to all
the glamour of the city, to go for dinner in one of the
famous restaurants, to ride in a hansom cab through
Central Park behind a plodding old horse, to race
through the bright streets and gather in all the excitement
of New York in one whirling evening. The
temptation had been strong, but Peggy had bravely
fought it off. She had work to do before her tryout
the next day at the New York Dramatic Academy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>After a fine but hurried dinner in the hotel&rsquo;s handsome,
formal dining room, Peggy and her parents
went upstairs to work on her readings. She read first
the passage she had marked out from <i>Twelfth Night</i>,
since Viola was a familiar role for her and she
needed only a short time to work on it. The speech
she selected was the best known in the play, and for
that reason it was probably the hardest to do, for
everyone who would hear it would have his own idea
of how it should sound. Any actor knows how hard it
is to put new life into old, familiar words, and Peggy
was well aware of this. Still, because this short speech
gave her a chance, in only a dozen lines, to indicate
the whole character of Viola, she thought it was
worth the risk.</p>
<p>Viola, pretending to be a boy, tells the Duke
Orsino of a sister she never had, and by so doing, confesses
her own love for the Duke. The first difficulty
of the speech lay in making Viola seem both a boy
and a lovesick girl at the same time. The second difficulty
was to make the imaginary sister of the speech
seem like a real person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Mr. Lane began, reading the Duke&rsquo;s lines, in which
he says that no woman can love as deeply as a man.
When the speech was done, Peggy spoke, sounding at
first completely feminine, &ldquo;Ay, but I know&mdash;&rdquo; She
broke off the phrase in well-acted confusion, as Viola
quickly realizes that she has spoken as a woman,
rather than as the boy she is supposed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well what love women to men may owe,&rdquo;
Peggy answered firmly, saying the line with boyish
confidence. Then she went on, in a confidential,
man-to-man tone: &ldquo;In faith, they are as true of heart
as we./My father had a daughter loved a man,/As it
might be, perhaps were I a woman,/I should your
lordship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s her history?&rdquo; Mr. Lane said.</p>
<p>Now Peggy subtly shifted the character, and when
she replied, after a short pause, it was not in the
manner of either the lovesick girl or the confident,
manly boy. Now she spoke dreamily, a story-teller, a
poet, as Viola fell into her own pretended character,
half-believing in the &ldquo;sister&rdquo; she had created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blank, my lord. She never told her love,/But let
concealment, like a worm i&rsquo; the bud,/Feed on her
damask cheek. She pined in thought,/And with a
green and yellow melancholy/She sat, like Patience
on a monument,/Smiling at grief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was interrupted by a round of applause from
both her parents, and responded with a start, suddenly
realizing that she was in a hotel room, not in
the court of the Duke Orsino or even on a stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s more to the speech!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t have applauded yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it, Peg,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;Besides,
I&rsquo;m afraid that if you work on that any more, you
might ruin it. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s perfect just
the way it is. You can do the whole speech tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re just being a loving father,&rdquo; Peggy answered,
in pleased confusion, but she knew that there
was more to his comments and compliments than this.
She remembered how, during the weeks when she
first struggled to breathe life into the character of Viola,
her father had read lines with her and criticized
sharply every time she did something not quite true
to the role. Remembering this, her pleasure now
was doubled. Even so, Peggy insisted on reading the
whole speech, then doing it several times over, before
she would go on to her next marked reading.</p>
<p>Sabina, in <i>Skin of Our Teeth</i>, was a complete
change of pace. Peggy worked on the satirical, comic,
sometimes silly-sounding lines for two hours before
she felt she was ready to go on. Then, two more hours
went swiftly by as she developed the poetic, passionate
lines of Maxwell Anderson&rsquo;s Winterset, working
on Miriamne&rsquo;s death scene.</p>
<p>When at last she was satisfied, it was a little after
midnight, and Peggy felt exhausted, as if she herself
had died with Miriamne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have done Sabina last,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe
I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so much as if I had just been murdered
after three acts of blank verse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said, &ldquo;you might
not have been so ready for sleep as you are now, and
sleep is what you need most, if you&rsquo;re going to do as
well in the morning as you did tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added Peggy&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;We have
just time for eight good hours of rest and a decent
breakfast tomorrow before you go to keep your ten-o&rsquo;clock
date with destiny. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy didn&rsquo;t argue. She kissed her parents, went
to her own adjoining bedroom and, in three minutes,
was curled up between the crisp, fresh sheets. Tonight
she was too tired to think about the excitement
to come. She had barely settled her head on the
pillow before she was deep in a dreamless sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Two Auditions</i></span></h2>
<p>Peggy hadn&rsquo;t really known what to expect of the
New York Dramatic Academy, but whatever it was, it
wasn&rsquo;t this!</p>
<p>The Academy was housed on two floors of an ancient
office building only a few blocks away from
their hotel. On either side of a tall door that led into
a long, dim hallway was an assorted collection of
name plates, telling passers-by what to expect inside.
One somewhat blackened brass plaque, about a
foot square, gave the name of the Academy. Other
plaques, some brass, some plastic, some polished and
others almost illegible, announced that the building
also provided offices for a dentist, studios for two ballet
schools and a voice teacher, and the workshop of
a noted costume designer. Other trades represented
included theatrical agents, song writers, an export-import
company, an advertising agency, and a custom
bootmaker specializing in ballet footwear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>At the end of the hall, two old elevators wheezed
and grunted their way up and down in grillwork
shafts. Over the ornate elevator doors were indicators
telling on what floors the elevators were. Neither of
them worked. But, when one car landed with a sigh
of relief and its gates slid open with a creak, Peggy
found that the operator was, surprisingly, a young
man, quite good-looking and smartly uniformed. He
greeted her courteously and took her to the top floor
with the air of a man who was giving her a lift in his
own chauffeured limousine.</p>
<p>The minute Peggy looked around her, any misgivings
she had about the building vanished. The
atmosphere was ageless, shabby, and completely theatrical.
The elusive smell, both indefinable and familiar,
but which was nothing but the smell of backstage,
perfumed the hall. Through a closed door to her left,
Peggy heard a chorus reciting in unison some lines
from a Greek play she could not identify. Directly
in front, through an open door in a wall of doors,
Peggy saw a tiny theater of perhaps one hundred
seats. A few people lounged in the front seats while
on the bare stage, under a single floodlight, two
young men acted out what sounded like a violent
quarrel. To the right, where the long hallway was
crossed by another hall, a boy appeared, swinging a
fencing foil. He turned the corner out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be where I go,&rdquo; Peggy thought, starting
for a nearby door marked <span class="sc">OFFICE</span>. She took a deep
breath, opened the door, and walked in.</p>
<p>The pretty receptionist, greeting her by name,
said that she was expected and that Mr. Macaulay,
the director of the Academy, would see her right
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The first thing that Peggy noticed was the office, in
the elaborate clutter of which Mr. Macaulay seemed
to have disappeared. It was a large, square room, its
walls paneled from the Oriental rugs to the high,
carved ceiling. Two tall windows draped in red velvet
showed glimpses of rooftops and river through
lace curtains. Every available piece of wall was
covered with pictures: photographs of people who
were surely actors and actresses, paintings of people
and of places, heavily framed etchings, newspaper
clippings, book jackets, theater programs, old theater
posters, magazine articles and, apparently, everything
else that could possibly fit into a frame. Where
there were not pictures, there were books, except for
one narrow wall space between the windows, where
there was a small marble fireplace, over the mantel of
which rose a tall mirror. The mantel itself was a
jumble of pipes, tobacco tins, more pictures in small
frames, china figurines, candlesticks and boxes assembled
around a pendulum clock which stood motionless
under a bell-shaped glass cover.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room was a heavily carved
black grand piano, covered with a fringed cloth and
stacked high with ragged piles of sheet music, play
scripts, books, more pipes, more pictures.</p>
<p>In the opposite corner stood an immense desk, also
heavily carved, and behind its incredibly cluttered
surface rose the tall back of a thronelike chair. In
the chair, almost lost from view, sat Mr. Macaulay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>When Peggy first realized he was there, she almost
laughed, thinking of various animals whose protective
coloration lets them melt into their natural
backgrounds, the way the dappled coat of a deer
seems merely more of the forest pattern of light and
shade.</p>
<p>Mr. Macaulay was as ornate as his room. He was a
small, round man who concealed a cherubic smile beneath
a pair of curly, white handlebar mustaches.
His red cheeks and white hair made the perfect setting
for bright blue eyes that glittered behind an
old-fashioned pair of pince-nez glasses perched precariously
on his nose. A black ribbon from the eyeglasses
ended in a gold fitting secured in his lapel.
The round expanse of his shirt front was covered by
a brocaded, double-breasted vest such as Peggy had
never seen except in movies set in the Gay Nineties,
and when Mr. Macaulay rose in smiling greeting and
came around the end of the desk, Peggy could not
help looking down to see if he wore gray spats. He
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; Mr. Macaulay boomed in a surprising
bass voice. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s sit down and talk this
over.&rdquo; He motioned Peggy to sit on one of a pair of
straight-backed chairs, while he stood by the other
with one foot up on its petit-point seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;what makes you think
you can act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken aback, Peggy stammered a little. &ldquo;Well ...
well, I&rsquo;ve been in a lot of plays in college and high
school and ... and I always got good reviews ...
I mean, everybody always thought that I was....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Mr. Macaulay cut in decisively.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me why other people think you can
act. What I want to know is why <i>you</i> think you can
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, Peggy answered with more control. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t really think I can, Mr. Macaulay,&rdquo; she said
calmly and earnestly, &ldquo;even though I did get those
good notices. But I know that I want to, and I hope
that I can learn here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good answer!&rdquo; the little director thundered
happily. &ldquo;Now tell me <i>why</i> you want to act, and how
you <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s what you really want to do, and we&rsquo;ll
be well on the way to a lasting friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy thought for a minute before answering. She
sensed that her answer would be important in deciding
whether she would be accepted as a member of
the Academy or not, and she wanted to be sure that
the words were a true reflection of what she wanted
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Macaulay, I want to act for the same reason
that I grew up in Rockport, Wisconsin. It just happened.
I didn&rsquo;t choose it; it chose me. And I know it&rsquo;s
what I really want because when I&rsquo;m acting, I feel
about one hundred per cent more alive than when
I&rsquo;m not&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a wonderful feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Mr. Macaulay nodded solemnly, removed his foot
from the chair and walked twice around the room in
silence, neatly dodging the chairs and tables that
filled the place. As he seemed to be starting a third
circuit of the room, he stopped, turned and replaced
his foot on the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; the little director said softly, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;re any more alive on the stage than you are right
here in this room, you&rsquo;ll light up the audience like an
arc lamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he strode rapidly to the door, opened it, and
turned to smile warmly at Peggy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pleasure
meeting you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Macaulay,&rdquo; Peggy said, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you even
give me a chance to read for you? I&rsquo;ve got three short
selections prepared, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for at least six months,&rdquo; the director cut in.
&ldquo;I never hear readings from beginners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months? Then I can&rsquo;t start this term!&rdquo; Peggy
said, almost in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll start this term,&rdquo; Mr. Macaulay
said. &ldquo;We begin in two weeks. Miss Carson will give
you all the necessary forms and the catalogue and
anything else you need. Glad to have you with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ... but ...&rdquo; Peggy sputtered. &ldquo;You mean
I&rsquo;m accepted? Without even reading for you? Just
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; Mr. Macaulay agreed calmly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe in readings. What I look for is personality
and presence and a feeling for the stage. The
right kind of feeling for the stage,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;As for
the readings, I&rsquo;ll be glad to hear you after you&rsquo;ve had
about six months of work with the Academy. I can
tell you&rsquo;ll be one of our good ones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>With a few words of farewell to the confused
Peggy, he led her to Miss Carson&rsquo;s desk and quickly
retreated to what Peggy already thought of as his
&ldquo;natural habitat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Only after she was through with Miss Carson
and her papers and forms and was on the way down
in the ancient elevator did it finally dawn on Peggy
that she had actually gotten what she had wanted
for years&mdash;she was accepted in the best dramatic
school in New York! The elevator seemed hardly big
enough to hold her; she wanted to run, to jump, to
sing! What she was actually doing seemed the silliest
thing imaginable. She was grinning a wide, foolish
grin and at the same time tasting the salty tears
that were probably smearing her mascara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; said the elevator operator. &ldquo;Not
everyone makes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! How did you know?&rdquo; Peggy gasped, dabbing
at her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew you were trying when I saw you come up
with the play scripts,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And I knew you
made it when I saw your face.&rdquo; He slid back the
squealing grillwork gate. &ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See you
in a couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the long hall, the doorway filled with
sunshine seemed to be paved with gold. Outside, it
seemed to Peggy, the whole city was paved with gold.
She impulsively ran to the door, poised in the sunlight,
and blew a theatrical kiss at the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>When Peggy, bubbling with her news, returned to
the hotel, it was decided to fill the time before lunch
with a necessary shopping tour. She needed so much,
now that she was to live in New York. Mr. Lane
decided to let Peggy and her mother take care of
this aspect of the trip, while he visited some old
newspaper friends. He arranged to meet them for
lunch at the hotel in two hours, kissed them fondly,
and boarded a bus downtown.</p>
<p>Rockport was never like this, Peggy thought, as she
and her mother walked along looking in shop windows.
They were so excited just deciding which
stores to shop in and what things she needed, that
before they had a chance to actually buy anything,
it was time for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least we had a chance to find out where all the
nice stores are,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said. &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t matter
that we didn&rsquo;t get you your things. You&rsquo;ll probably
have more fun going shopping by yourself or with
some of your new friends when you come back here
to live. Besides, we won&rsquo;t have to bring things home
and then carry them all the way back to New York
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy agreed that it made sense, and at the
thought of her &ldquo;new friends&rdquo; and of buying her own
things in New York&rsquo;s world-famous stores, she got a
little thrill of pleasure and anticipation.</p>
<p>After lunch, made memorable by Mr. Lane&rsquo;s new
collection of newspaper stories picked up from his
old friends, it was time to travel downtown to meet
May Berriman and see where Peggy would be living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>As their taxi took them downtown from the hotel,
Peggy noticed how the city seemed to change character
every few blocks. The types of buildings and the
kinds of stores changed; the neighborhood grew progressively
more shabby; there were more trucks in
the streets and fewer taxis. Peggy wondered what
sort of neighborhood May Berriman&rsquo;s place was in.
Mrs. Lane, too, looked a bit concerned and whispered
to Mr. Lane, &ldquo;Are you sure we&rsquo;re going the right
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded and said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know New York.
Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of what appeared to be a district of
warehouses and office buildings, the cab turned a
corner, and a swift change again overtook the city.
Suddenly there were well-kept apartment houses and
residential hotels and then, with another turn, it was
as if time itself had been turned back!</p>
<p>The street ended in a beautiful old-fashioned park
surrounded by a high wrought-iron fence in which
were set tall gates. The street around the park was
lined with old, mellow brick mansions whose steps
led up to high doors fitted with gleaming brass
knobs, knockers, and hinges. Peggy almost expected
to see top-hatted gentlemen emerge from them to descend,
swinging slim canes, to waiting carriages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Gramercy Park,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still
one of the most fashionable and beautiful parts of the
city. May&rsquo;s house is just off the park, and she tells me
she has park rights for herself and the girls who live
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park rights?&rdquo; Peggy said wonderingly. &ldquo;Do you
mean it&rsquo;s a private park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; her father answered. &ldquo;One of the
last in New York. Its use is limited to people who live
right around it, all of whom have keys to the gates.
That&rsquo;s one thing that makes this such a nice place to
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab had made almost a complete circle of the
park when the driver turned off into a side street.
Two doors down he stopped before a handsome
brownstone house, complete with the steep steps and
brass fittings that were typical of the area. On either
side of the steps, at street level, stood a square stone
column, and on each one was a polished brass plate
engraved: <span class="sc">Gramercy Arms</span>.</p>
<p>As Peggy started up the steps she caught a glimpse
through the windows in the little areaway below
street level. The spacious kitchen she saw looked far
more typical of Rockport than anything she would
have expected to find in New York City, and it made
her feel sure that she would like living in May
Berriman&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>May Berriman herself proved to be as big and as
warm looking and as countrified as her kitchen. Her
erect carriage and bright-red hair belied her more
than sixty years, and her voice was deep and even,
with none of the quaver that Peggy was used to hearing
in older people. She met them at the door with
vast and impartial enthusiasm, kissed them all and
ushered them into a tiny sitting room, tastefully furnished
with a mixture of modern and antique pieces.
They had scarcely had time to say hello when tea
was served by a bright-eyed, kimonoed Japanese
woman who might have been any age at all. Peggy
watched in silent pleasure as May Berriman poured
the tea in the formal English style, using an essence,
fresh boiled water, an alcohol burner to keep the tea
hot, and an assortment of tongs, spoons, and strainers.
It was not until each of them had a fragile cup of
hot, fragrant tea and a plate of delicate little sandwiches
that May Berriman sat back, relaxed, for conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy, your father told me on the phone that you
have been accepted in the Academy. I&rsquo;m delighted.
Now tell me, what do you think of Archer Macaulay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; Peggy admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met
anyone like him. Is he always as abrupt as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always!&rdquo; May Berriman laughed. &ldquo;Ever since I&rsquo;ve
known Archie&mdash;and that goes back a good many
years&mdash;he&rsquo;s tried to act like a bad playwright&rsquo;s idea
of an Early Victorian theatrical genius. It&rsquo;s a peculiar
sort of act when you first see it, but after a
while you get used to it and hardly notice at all. Besides,
it&rsquo;s not all sham. He may not be Early Victorian,
but he is a theatrical genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he an actor?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, no! Only in his personal life! There&rsquo;s a
world of difference between acting and teaching;
you hardly ever find anyone who&rsquo;s good at both. Macaulay&rsquo;s
a magnificent teacher, so he had sense
enough never even to try acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Peggy objected, &ldquo;how can you teach something
you can&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Berriman smiled. &ldquo;Oh, Archie can do, all
right. He&rsquo;s that rarest of all talents&mdash;a talented audience.
He knows when something is good and when
it isn&rsquo;t, and if it&rsquo;s not good, he knows just what it
lacks. He just keeps asking for what he wants, and
when he gets it&mdash;if he gets it&mdash;it turns out to be just
what everyone else wants, too. That&rsquo;s why he has
been able to discover and develop more fine talent
than any other man of our time. You&rsquo;re a lucky girl to
be able to work with Archer Macaulay. Even to be accepted
for his school is a great honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded in understanding as May Berriman
talked about the talent for recognizing talent, remembering
her last conversation with her friend
Jean Wilson. Maybe some day, Peggy thought, she
herself, an old retired actress, would be serving tea in
her own house, and talking in just such tones of
affection and admiration for her friend Jean, who
would then be the famous director of the best dramatic
school in....</p>
<p>She was brought out of her daydream by her
mother, who touched her arm gently and said, &ldquo;Back
to earth, dear. Mrs. Berriman wants to show us the
room you&rsquo;re to have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The room was small, but comfortably furnished as
a sitting room, with a large couch that opened to a
bed. Two tall windows with window seats set in their
deep frames looked out into the tops of two lacy trees
that rose from a tiny, well-kept garden. An easy chair
and a low table stood in front of a little fireplace that
really worked&mdash;a rare thing in New York. An antique
desk between the windows and a large bureau
opposite the fireplace completed the furnishings. The
couch was covered in a deep blue that matched the
blue carpet, the walls were white, and the windows
were draped in a white fabric with blue cabbage
roses. The same fabric covered the easy chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo; Peggy said, and rushed off to try
the big easy chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to love it here!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;In fact, I hardly want to go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Peg,&rdquo; Mr. Lane said, looking at his
watch, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re going to have to
do, and in a very few minutes. If we want to make
our plane, we&rsquo;d better be getting back to the hotel to
pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brief good-by, the taxi ride around Gramercy
Park and back uptown, the hurried packing, the trip
to the airport and the now-familiar process of boarding
and take-off seemed to Peggy as fast, as jerky
and peculiar as a movie run backward. She wanted
to play it back right again, to put everything in its
proper sequence, and live over her exciting day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what she did, in her mind&rsquo;s eye,
all the way back to Rockport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Starting a New Role</i></span></h2>
<p>Rockport had never looked so little as it did from the
air. The plane circled the town at dusk, just as the
stewardess finished serving supper, and as Peggy
looked down from the oval window next to her seat,
she saw the street lights suddenly flick on, section by
section, all over the town. The familiar streets glowed
under their canopies of trees, the houses were almost
hidden under other trees and, in the center of the
town, a few neon lights added warmth and color.</p>
<p>Peggy hardly knew what she felt for the place
where she had been born and where she had lived
her whole life. A wave of tenderness came over her
for Rockport, so small and homelike, surrounded by
its farms and forests and lakes. And at the same time,
she compared this view from the air with the sight of
New York, towering and dramatic in the afternoon
sunshine. Who could settle for Rockport, after breathing
the excitement of the giant city? Still ... she
wondered if New York could ever be to her the home
that Rockport was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The somewhat bumpy runway of Armory Field
was under their wheels. Peggy was home again. But
in her mind, she was still in the city, starting her new
and wonderful life.</p>
<p>After quickly unpacking and changing to a skirt
and blouse more suitable to Rockport than the smart
traveling suit she had worn on the plane, Peggy came
running downstairs. Her father sat in his easy chair
reading the two issues of the <i>Eagle</i> that had come out
in his absence. Her mother sat in the wing chair opposite,
working serenely on her needle point. To look
at them, Peggy thought, one would suppose that they
had never left home, that nothing at all had changed
from what it had been two days ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for a while,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
just got to tell Jean right away, or I&rsquo;ll burst for sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t stay
out too late. You&rsquo;ve had an exciting day, and you&rsquo;re
going to need some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand, Peggy left and, whistling
boyishly, skipped down the front steps. Once on the
street, the last of her grown-up reserve left her,
and she ran all the way to the Wilson house to arrive,
panting and breathlessly bright-eyed, a few moments
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean&rsquo;s down at the Sweet Shop,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilson said,
&ldquo;but I know she&rsquo;ll want to see you. I&rsquo;ll call and tell
her not to leave, and you can meet her there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Peggy thanked Mrs. Wilson briefly, and ran back
home once more to collect her bike. As she pedaled
down Chestnut Street, she wondered how many more
times she would ride her bike again. It was not the
sort of thing one did in New York, obviously. And
besides, the bike was a part of her childhood and
early teens, and now she was coming out of them
and off to the great adventure of becoming a woman!
Thinking this, she slowed down a little, so as to enjoy
the ride and the familiar sights around her. Growing
up would happen soon enough, she now knew. Meanwhile,
she wanted to slowly taste and enjoy the pleasures
of small-town girlhood that were not to come
again.</p>
<p>Her subdued mood lasted only until she arrived at
the Sweet Shop. There she found Jean, Betty Dugan,
Alice Schultz, and Millie Pratt crowded around a
soda-laden table, laughing and talking. They managed
to make room for one more chair and as soon as
Peggy was seated, turned silent, expectant faces to
her.</p>
<p>Looking from face to face, Peggy suddenly
laughed. &ldquo;You look like a nestful of baby birds waiting
to be fed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she told her friends the whole story of her
trip, starting, of course, with the main fact that she
had been accepted at Mr. Macaulay&rsquo;s famous New
York Dramatic Academy. Describing him, she acted
him out for them, and soon had the girls in fits of
laughter. Then she went on to tell about May Berriman,
the room she would live in, the quaint old-fashioned
neighborhood around Gramercy Park, the
private park and all the rest. When she had finished,
she said to Jean, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you want to change
your mind? I do wish you&rsquo;d come, too. It&rsquo;s going to be
wonderful, but with you there, it would be absolutely
perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Jean shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;I must admit it
sounds tempting,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I stand on what I
told you before about what I want to do. I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m an actress at all, and if I tried to be one, I&rsquo;d probably
only fail. And that wouldn&rsquo;t make me happy at
all. If I do what I plan to, though, I&rsquo;ll probably succeed,
and that way I&rsquo;ll have a happy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded her agreement. &ldquo;I guess I was only
testing you, in a way,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;just to see if
you really meant it. Now that I know you do, I&rsquo;m
sure that you&rsquo;re absolutely right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she told her friend about the discussion she
had had with May Berriman about Mr. Macaulay, and
what the older woman had told Peggy about his great
ability as a teacher and his lack of ability as an actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, too, that the ability to recognize talent
and to develop it is a lot rarer than the talent itself.
And all the time she was talking, I was thinking about
you and our last talk together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that makes me feel a lot better,&rdquo; Jean admitted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to know that there are other people&mdash;real
professionals&mdash;who think about things the
same way I do. Thanks for telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Then the talk turned to other things besides the
theater: clothes, boys, the coming school year at
Rockport Community College, for which Peggy
would not be there&mdash;all the hundreds of things that
girls talk about. Before Peggy realized it, it was ten-thirty,
and she was beginning to yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the company,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the hour. Not
exactly original, but perfectly true. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d
better be getting home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed that it was their bedtime too,
and they trooped out to the bicycle rack to say their
good nights. Peggy and Jean rode side by side slowly
down the leafy street, feeling the first slight chill that
announced the end of summer was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be leaving?&rdquo; Jean asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess in about a week,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;The term
starts in two weeks, and I want to get settled in New
York before school begins, so that I can have my
mind all clear for work. I think I&rsquo;ll need a week just
to get really comfortable in my room, do the shopping
I&rsquo;ll have to do, and find my way around the city. I
want to know about buses and subways and things
like that before I get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a good idea to me,&rdquo; Jean replied.
&ldquo;What I would do if I were you is to get a street
map of the city, and a guidebook, and spend some
time just wandering around so you get the idea of
where things are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I plan to do,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;In
fact, my father suggested the same thing. He said
that I should go on a few guided tours, too. They have
buses that take tourists all around the city and show
them everything of interest. Dad says that native
New Yorkers, and people who are trying to make
other people think that they&rsquo;re native New Yorkers,
are ashamed to be seen on the sight-seeing buses,
which seems pretty silly to me. The result is that
people who come from out of town often know more
about New York than the people who have grown up
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls laughed at the idea, then Peggy continued,
&ldquo;I plan to spend at least a week taking tours,
and walking around the streets with a guidebook, and
shopping. I&rsquo;d better leave next week, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so soon,&rdquo; Jean said a little sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to miss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is soon,&rdquo; Peggy admitted, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather be
rushed than have to wait for a month and think about
nothing but the day I&rsquo;m going to leave. Even as it is,
there&rsquo;ll be too much time for good-bys, and I hate
saying good-by. Especially to people I care for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls rode the rest of the way in silence, each
thinking her own thoughts about their long association
which was now to come to an end. They came to
Peggy&rsquo;s house first and stopped their bikes.</p>
<p>Then Peggy said, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll write,&rdquo; as if she
were answering a question that Jean had asked.</p>
<p>Jean laughed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! That&rsquo;s just what I was
thinking! I wonder how long it&rsquo;ll be before either
of us finds another person we can do that with again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we ever will,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s probably just as well. There&rsquo;s something a little
weird about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Then, on common impulse, they recited in chorus
the witches&rsquo; lines from <i>Macbeth</i>, only changing the
&ldquo;three&rdquo; to &ldquo;two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we two meet again? In thunder,
lightning, or in rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with laughter and witchlike cackles, they said
good night.</p>
<p class="tb">The next week flew by in a continual round of farewells,
packing, endless talk in the Sweet Shop about
acting and the life Peggy would be leading in New
York and, the night before her departure, a big farewell
party at Jean&rsquo;s house. It was a tired Peggy, glad
to be on her way at last, who found herself once more
at the airport with her parents. But this time, she was
to fly alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you packed everything?&rdquo; her mother
asked for perhaps the tenth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; Peggy assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know how to get from the airport to
Gramercy Park?&rdquo; her father asked, also for perhaps
the tenth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget!&rdquo; Peggy laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; Mrs. Lane said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; Mr. Lane said.</p>
<p>They stood, all three, looking at one another, not
knowing what to say. Then Peggy&rsquo;s mother, with
more than a faint suspicion of tears in her eyes,
threw her arms about her daughter and kissed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get on that
plane right away, or I am going to be silly and cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy kissed both her parents and started through
the gate across the concrete strip where the big plane
waited. As she turned to wave good-by, her mother
called, &ldquo;Are you sure you have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Peggy shouted back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget to phone the minute you get
there!&rdquo; her father called, his last words drowned out
by the sound of a plane that swooped low overhead.</p>
<p>At the top of the boarding steps, Peggy waved
again for the last time, then went in to her seat to
start her first flight alone&mdash;a flight that would bring
her to all she had ever hoped for.</p>
<p class="tb">It was dark when the plane arrived in New York
this time, and if Peggy had thought the sight breathtaking
when she first saw it, she was absolutely
stunned by this!</p>
<p>In every direction, as far as she could see, the
streets stretched out like blazing strings of lights,
white, red, blue, green, with sudden bursts and knots
of brighter light where major streets joined. As the
plane banked and turned, she saw a superhighway
winding along the edge of a bay, interrupted by
complicated cloverleafs, underpasses and overpasses.
The lights on the highway were diamond-blue, and
the road was dotted with headlights and taillights of
thousands of cars like fireflies in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Then the turning of the plane revealed midtown
Manhattan, tall and sparkling! The Empire State
Building towered over all, its four bright beams
sweeping the sky over the city. The UN building
stood out like a solid slab of brilliance against the
rest of the skyline. Beyond it, Times Square blazed
like a bonfire.</p>
<p>All around her in the plane, Peggy saw the rest of
the passengers, including obviously experienced
travelers, pressed against the windows, enchanted
by the fairy-tale sight below. They were all talking,
pointing, comparing notes on the beauty of this or
that.</p>
<p>The plane swept lower now, and the skyline
seemed to rise and grow even more mighty. Over the
East River, the bridges were spider-webs and pearls;
small boats like water bugs skimmed under them and
out again. Then, abruptly, a new and closer brilliance
of searchlights and whirling red and green signals&mdash;and
the plane settled smoothly into the bustle and
roar of LaGuardia Airport.</p>
<p>Peggy was glad that she had been there before
with her parents, or she might never have found her
way out. Crowds of people swarmed about the place,
sweeping past in every direction. Piles of luggage
and groups of waiting travelers seemed to block her
way no matter where she turned. Ignoring the crowds
as best she could, and following her sense of direction
and her memory of where she had gone the
previous week, Peggy worked her way to the front of
the terminal where the taxi stand was. A bank of
phone booths reminded her to call home before going
on. Then she hailed a cab and gave the driver the
address of the Gramercy Arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>She had planned to take the airport bus to the terminal
in Manhattan and a cab from there, but she
had changed her mind. This one extravagance,
Peggy felt, would be worth the price. Settling back in
comfort, she opened the window to a cool rush of air
and became absorbed in the passing sights of parkways,
streets, bridges and, finally, the entrance over
the giant Triborough Bridge into the enchanted isle
of Manhattan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first trip to New York?&rdquo; the taxi driver asked,
noticing her fascination with the sights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peggy answered, feeling herself quite the
experienced traveler. &ldquo;I was here last week. But that
was the first time,&rdquo; she confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staying long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever, I hope!&rdquo; Peggy replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to live
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The East River Drive went into a sort of tunnel,
supported on one side by pillars, through which
Peggy could see a string of barges slowly forging
upstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s above us?&rdquo; the driver asked.
&ldquo;No? It&rsquo;s a park! That&rsquo;s right. This road is built under
a park!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther on, after they had come out of the tunnel,
they plunged into another one. &ldquo;Another park?&rdquo;
Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. This time it&rsquo;s an apartment house!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The third time the road went underground, it was
the UN building that was above them. What a fantastic city!
Peggy thought. Everything seemed topsy-turvy.
The idea of driving under parks, apartment
houses and giant office buildings was so queer! She
said as much to the driver, who only laughed. &ldquo;Miss,
you&rsquo;ll get used to all sorts of queer things if you live
here! I&rsquo;ve been driving a cab in this town for twenty-four
years now, and I haven&rsquo;t seen the end of odd
things. As fast as you can see one, they build two
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Gramercy Arms, the
driver leaped out and helped her with her bags up
the steep front steps. She didn&rsquo;t know then how unusual
it was for a cab driver to help with luggage. He
was being really gallant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; he said, on leaving. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need it.
It&rsquo;s not an easy town to get started in, but young girls
like you come here every day to try, and most of them
make it somehow. Just don&rsquo;t let it scare you. It&rsquo;s
big, but it&rsquo;s not unfriendly. And there&rsquo;s no place else
in this world that I&rsquo;d rather live!&rdquo; With a wave of
farewell, he climbed into his cab and rode off around
the corner.</p>
<p>Peggy took a deep breath, patted her hair, and
rang the bell of her new home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Cast of Characters</i></span></h2>
<p>The door was opened, not by Mrs. Berriman, but by
a small, dark-haired girl with huge, black eyes and a
gamin grin, who greeted her with a decided French
accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allo, allo!&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;Come een! Are you
Amee or Peggee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m Peggy,&rdquo; Peggy said, somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the French girl cried. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like
an Amee! I&rsquo;m Gaby, wheech ees short for Gabrielle.
I leeve &rsquo;ere. Maman Berriman she ees out shopping,
mais les autres girls sont ici. Pardon. I meex too much
French een with my talk. Parlez-vous Fran&ccedil;ais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Un peu,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;A very little peu, I&rsquo;m
afraid. But I understood you. You said the other
girls are here, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parfait!&rdquo; Gaby grinned. &ldquo;Maybee I can teach you
how to speak, if you would like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; Peggy agreed enthusiastically, but
added quickly, &ldquo;not starting right now, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Gaby shrugged. &ldquo;Come on! I first introduce
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Four girls waited in the large, comfortable living
room, all looking expectantly at the door. As Peggy
entered, a pert-faced redhead bounced out of her
chair to say hello.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dot,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Are you Peggy or
Amy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggee, of course!&rdquo; Gaby cut in, before Peggy
could answer. &ldquo;Does she look like an Amee to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dot said reflectively.
&ldquo;Well, welcome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Now will somebody
tell me who Amy is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you first,&rdquo; Dot answered, taking
Peggy by the arm. &ldquo;This is Irene, our household
beauty queen,&rdquo; she said. Irene, a tall, startlingly
beautiful brunette, languidly waved a gesture of welcome
with long, perfectly manicured fingers. Smiling,
she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind her jealous tones, Peggy. They
say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and
that means that she must love me, or she&rsquo;d think I
was ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pretty, round-faced girl with almost white blond
hair done in a long single braid came over to Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sound very catty,&rdquo; she said with a gentle
smile, &ldquo;but we think they wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do
without each other. Now, no fighting tonight,&rdquo; she
said to Dot and Irene. &ldquo;We want to give Peggy a
chance to get used to us first.&rdquo; Then, turning back to
Peggy, she said, &ldquo;My name is Greta. Your room is
right next door to mine. And this is Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Maggie, all freckles, brown bangs, and bright
China-blue eyes, was sitting cross-legged on the floor.
Without uncrossing her legs, she rose effortlessly, offered
a wiry handshake and a warm grin, and sank
back to her former position in one fluid movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not showing off,&rdquo; Dot said, noticing Peggy&rsquo;s
startled look. &ldquo;She does that sort of thing all the time
without even thinking about it. She&rsquo;s a dancer, and
she makes the rest of us seem like a herd of elephants
by comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not elephants,&rdquo; Maggie said. &ldquo;Not since I&rsquo;ve been
teaching you all how to move and walk. Maybe buffalo,
but not elephants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know &rsquo;ow to move and walk?&rdquo; Gaby asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought so, but now I&rsquo;m beginning to
have my doubts,&rdquo; Peggy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk to the door and then back,&rdquo; Maggie said.</p>
<p>Peggy did so, trying to be as graceful as she could,
without seeming in any way affected. She had never
really considered her walking ability before, and now
that she was doing so, under the close scrutiny of the
five girls, she suddenly felt that she had never walked
before. Coming back to Maggie, she waited hopefully
for her judgment. &ldquo;Elephant?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Maggie said, as if trying to find just the
right kind of beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffalo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little better than buffalo, I think. Maybe a well-bred
cart horse. But don&rsquo;t feel bad about it. You
haven&rsquo;t had lessons yet. Now, we can start by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can start by sitting down and getting to know
each other first,&rdquo; Greta interrupted. &ldquo;Come on, Peggy.
You must be really confused by all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Peggy admitted. &ldquo;It seems that everyone
wants to teach me something. I was hardly in the
house when Gaby was offering French lessons! What
do you teach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to teach good manners to my crazy friends
here,&rdquo; Greta said with a laugh, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t seem to
be very good at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Peggy was established in a comfortable
chair, with the other girls around her, the first thing
she asked was, &ldquo;Now, who is Amy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy Shelby Preston is all we know about her,&rdquo;
Dot said, &ldquo;just as Peggy Lane is all we know about
you. That, and the fact that you were both due to get
here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t be the only
new girl in the place! That ought to make it a little
easier on me, and on all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not a new girl any more!&rdquo; Irene
laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only new around here for the first
five minutes, and you&rsquo;ve been here nearly ten by now!
If Amy Shelby Preston takes another half hour to get
here, you&rsquo;ll be an old-timer by then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, that ees so!&rdquo; Gaby put in. &ldquo;Everybodee here
ees so open&mdash;they tell you everytheeng about themselves
so tr&egrave;s vite&mdash;that means veree fast&mdash;that you
know them so like old friends in no time, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Peggy thought that this was a fine idea, and she
said so. Then, in accordance with what she now knew
to be the household custom, she told the five girls as
much about herself as she felt would be interesting to
them: where she was from, why she was in New York&mdash;a
five-minute autobiography.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... so, you see,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;I wanted to study
acting and I felt that this was the only place to go, so
here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty much the same with us,&rdquo; Dot said.
&ldquo;None of us is from New York either, and we all
came to be in the theater or some part of it. I&rsquo;m
a comedienne and eccentric dancer, and I sing a
little, too. I&rsquo;m not going to any school but I still work
with a voice coach and a drama coaching group. I&rsquo;m
from California originally. I was in a few movies, but
not in any good roles. I&rsquo;m not a movie type. I came
here when I got a chance to do a television series that
originated live from New York, and when the series
ended, I stuck around. I&rsquo;m in a Broadway musical
now, lost in the chorus. It&rsquo;s not much, but it pays the
rent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s too modest,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not just in
the chorus. She has a dance specialty and a few
lines, and she&rsquo;s understudying the lead comedienne.
And she&rsquo;s good at it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot blushed and said roughly, &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo;
sake, don&rsquo;t be nice to me! It makes me feel I have to
be nice to you, and that&rsquo;s not my character!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Greta answered promptly, &ldquo;All right, then, let&rsquo;s
talk about me! Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want stage center
isn&rsquo;t going to get it!&rdquo; She stood up, walked to the
center of the room and made a small pirouette, her
thick braid whirling around her. &ldquo;I am Greta Larsen
and I come from Boston,&rdquo; she recited in a little-girl
voice. &ldquo;I know I have a face like a Swedish dumpling,
and everybody thinks I should have come from there
or at least from Wisconsin like you. If you come from
Boston, you&rsquo;re supposed to be Irish. I&rsquo;m an ing&eacute;nue
and I&rsquo;ve been in four off-Broadway plays and one
Broadway play, and all of them were flops. Right now
I&rsquo;m working as a script editor for a TV producer, and
trying to make him realize that I&rsquo;m an actress. So far
he hardly realizes I&rsquo;m a script editor. He thinks I&rsquo;m
a hey-you.&rdquo; With a comic bow like a mechanical doll,
she sat down to a round of laughter and applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; Peggy said, still laughing. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
had such fun in ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaby, who stood up next, threw the girls into gales
of laughter by announcing first that she was French.
Then she went on to tell Peggy that her full name
was Gabrielle Odette Francine DuChamps Goulet,
but that she only used the name Gaby Odette. Her
mother was dead and her father worked for the UN
in New York, but spent most of his time traveling
about the world, only returning for a few weeks at a
time. Gaby had studied acting in France, and had
even attracted some critical attention and good personal
reviews in her one acting part in Paris, but
when her father came to America, she decided to
come with him and make a new start here. Since her
arrival about a year ago, she had been devoting all
of her energy to studying English, and hoped that in
another six months or so she would be good enough
to start looking for parts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m next,&rdquo; Irene said, stretching her long,
well-shaped legs and leaning back in her chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Irene Marshall, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; But just then the doorbell
rang, interrupting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Amy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t have
to tell my history twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She strode to the door to let the new arrival in, and
in a few seconds ushered her into the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Amy Preston,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;and this,&rdquo;
she continued, waving a hand at the five girls in the
living room, &ldquo;is a room full of girls. Come on in and
meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy thought that Amy Preston was just about
the prettiest girl she had ever seen, and as she
watched her gracefully shaking hands and saying
hello, she felt sure that they would be friends. Amy&rsquo;s
honey-blond hair framed a small oval face, large
brown eyes and a smiling, self-possessed expression.
When she spoke, it was with a soft, pleasant Southern
accent and a low voice. Irene introduced Amy
to Peggy last of all, and Peggy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad
to have you here. I&rsquo;m new too. I just came in about a
half hour ago, and I was so relieved to know that
I wasn&rsquo;t going to be the only new girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel heaps better too,&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;In
fact, as much as I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to New
York, I&rsquo;ve been half dreading this first meeting. I
may not look it, but I&rsquo;m really quite shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was just thinking how well you handled
yourself during all these introductions!&rdquo; Peggy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have to do that if you&rsquo;re shy,&rdquo; Amy
said. &ldquo;That way, people never know about it. It&rsquo;s
the same thing as going on the stage, I guess. They
say that the best actresses and actors are always just
nearly paralyzed with stage fright. In fact, I think
that&rsquo;s what adds the extra excitement to their presence.
At least I hope so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come to New York to act, too?&rdquo; Peggy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to, if I&rsquo;m lucky,&rdquo; Amy replied. &ldquo;But first off,
I came to study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Where are you studying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The New York Academy,&rdquo; Amy answered, with a
faintly perceptible touch of pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so am I!&rdquo; Peggy cried with delight.</p>
<p>The two of them quickly fell into an animated discussion
of the Academy and of Mr. Macaulay. They
were just comparing notes on their interviews with
him when Dot gently but firmly interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls will have a lot of time for all that, but
now it&rsquo;s time to do all the introductions. Amy, you
tell us about you, and then we&rsquo;ll go on about us. Gaby
and Greta and Peggy and I have told about us already,
so we won&rsquo;t repeat it now. We&rsquo;ll catch you tomorrow.
So there&rsquo;s only you and Irene and Maggie
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Then she explained about the household method
of introduction, which Amy agreed was a fine idea.</p>
<p>Amy&rsquo;s speech was short and direct. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Amy Preston,
and I come from Pine Hollow, North Carolina,
which nobody ever heard of except the people who
live there. I went to college for a year and acted
in four plays, and then I persuaded my parents to let
me come to New York to act. There&rsquo;s nothing else to
tell about me, except that I think I&rsquo;m the luckiest girl
I ever knew to find a place like this to live in and a
place like the Academy to study at. I know I&rsquo;m going
to like you all, and I hope you&rsquo;re going to like me,
too.&rdquo; Blushing slightly, she sat down, and Peggy noticed
that her hands were trembling a little. She
hadn&rsquo;t been fooling about the shyness and stage
fright then, Peggy thought, but she was certainly
able to keep it from showing, unless you looked very
closely. Peggy was sure that Amy would prove to be
a good actress.</p>
<p>The rest of the introductory speeches went swiftly.
Irene, it turned out, was from Cleveland. Her real
name was Irma Matysko, but she thought, and
everybody agreed, that Irene Marshall sounded a lot
better for a would-be actress. She had acted in several
television dramas in minor parts, and was supporting
herself mostly as a fashion model.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Maggie, the dancer, spoke next. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Maggie Delahanty,&rdquo;
she began, &ldquo;and I was actually born in Ireland,
only my parents brought me here when I was
two, so I don&rsquo;t remember anything about it. I was
raised in Philadelphia, where my father is a bus
driver, and I&rsquo;ve been dancing since I was three. I&rsquo;ve
worked in musicals on Broadway and on the road,
and I&rsquo;ve worked in night clubs, which I hate. Right
now I&rsquo;m studying singing with a fine coach, so that I
can get some good work, because there&rsquo;s nothing
much for a dancer who can&rsquo;t sing. I just got back last
week from a summer tour with a music circus, in
which I danced my way through ten states in as
many weeks. Right now, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going
to do, except sit down as much as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another one of her uncanny, fluid movements,
she sat down.</p>
<p>The general introductions done, Peggy and Amy
went back to their conversation about Mr. Macaulay
and the Academy. Amy&rsquo;s experience in her interview
had been much the same as Peggy&rsquo;s. She too
had prepared material to read and, like Peggy, had
thought at first that she was rejected when Mr. Macaulay
wouldn&rsquo;t let her read it. Now she could hardly
wait to get started.</p>
<p>Irene, who had heard all about Mr. Macaulay
and his brusque approach before she had tried to get
into the Academy a year ago, said that she knew she
hadn&rsquo;t made the grade the minute he had started
being kind to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he reject you?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;He said that a girl as pretty as me didn&rsquo;t need
acting lessons,&rdquo; Irene said with a laugh. &ldquo;He said
that even if I learned to be a good actress, I would
never have a chance to prove it, because I would be
given the kind of parts that just need looks. I told
him that I wanted to be a good actress as well as a
pretty one and he told me that it would be a tragic
mistake, because there aren&rsquo;t any parts written for
people like that!&rdquo; She laughed again, then in a more
sober tone, added, &ldquo;I think he was just being kind to
me and trying to make me feel good. And you know
what? He succeeded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the conversation turned to plays and roles and
types of actresses, the other girls joined in. They had
just gotten to a spirited and somewhat noisy discussion
of the ability of a well-known actress, when
May Berriman came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Amy and Peggy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve
met everybody and you&rsquo;re right at home! Good! Now
let me make you feel even more at home by acting
like a mother. Do you girls know that it&rsquo;s very late?
And do you know that I&rsquo;ve been busy making hot
chocolate for you? And that it&rsquo;s waiting in the kitchen
right now, getting cool? Well, now you know, so get
moving!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The seven girls and May Berriman trooped downstairs
to the big, homey kitchen that Peggy had noticed
on her first visit. Full of friendly people and
the smell of hot chocolate and homemade cookies,
the kitchen seemed to Peggy the nicest place she had
ever been. Seated in antique painted chairs around
the long sawbuck table with May Berriman at its
head, they passed around cookies and chocolate and
continued the discussion of the prominent actress,
carefully taking her apart, gesture by gesture, until
it seemed a wonder that she had ever gotten so much
as a walk-on role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very easy to criticize your elders and
betters,&rdquo; May Berriman finally said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s quite
another thing to stand up on the stage with them and
act on their level! That&rsquo;s not to say that I disapprove
of discussions like this. I think they&rsquo;re good, because
they do develop your critical abilities, but I think
they can be carried too far.&rdquo; With a glance at the
clock, she added, &ldquo;And I think this one has gone far
enough into the night. Now all of you, get up to bed.
Peggy and Amy haven&rsquo;t even unpacked yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Biggest Stage</i></span></h2>
<p>There were no meals served at May Berriman&rsquo;s
Gramercy Arms, but the big kitchen was considered
common property, and anyone who wanted to was
allowed to prepare breakfast and dinner there.
Lunches were eaten at restaurants and counters.</p>
<p>Each of the girls had a wire basket labeled and
filled with her own food in the giant hotel-size refrigerator,
and each was given shelf space for other
things. Since Peggy and Amy had not stocked up the
night before, the other girls invited them to share
breakfast with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a system,&rdquo; Dot said. &ldquo;Each of us cooks
for all the others in turn, but that&rsquo;s only for breakfast.
At dinnertime, you shift for yourself. The dishes
are done for us, thank Heaven, by Aniko, the housemaid.
We each contribute to a dishwashing fund
every week to keep Aniko happy. Since you&rsquo;re both
new, we&rsquo;ll put you at the end of the list, which gives
you about a week to get used to us in the morning,
before having to cook for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s being optimistic,&rdquo; Maggie called over her
shoulder from her position at the range. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible
to get used to us in the morning. How do you
like your eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They settled on scrambled, which was diplomatic,
since they noticed that Maggie was whipping up a
bowl of them for the others. In short order, they
were seated around the long table, eagerly eating the
eggs, bacon, toast and fresh sliced tomatoes, and
washing it down with good, hot coffee.</p>
<p>Irene and Greta huddled together, looking over
a copy of <i>Variety</i> and writing in small notebooks.
Catching Peggy&rsquo;s inquiring glance, Irene explained,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Variety</i>, the bible of show business. We&rsquo;re looking
at the casting notes. Every time a producer has a
play and wants to see new actors, he puts a notice in
the casting call page. The notices tell you what kind
of people he&rsquo;s looking for and when he&rsquo;ll see them.
We&rsquo;re looking&mdash;along with a thousand other actors&mdash;to
see if there&rsquo;s something for us. I&rsquo;ve got two that
sound interesting, and Greta&rsquo;s got one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you just go up and say, &lsquo;Here I am&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Amy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all I do,&rdquo; Irene admitted with a
laugh, &ldquo;because I just answer the ads for Showgirl
types and beautiful ing&eacute;nue roles. I just stand there
and hope they like my face and figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Peggy said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy! I&rsquo;m too tall for some, and too fashionable-looking
for others, or I should be blond, or
they wanted an outdoor type, or I&rsquo;m just what they&rsquo;re
looking for, but so are twelve other girls who all have
more acting credits. It&rsquo;s not easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no easier for me,&rdquo; Greta put in mournfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an even more definite physical type than Irene
is, and to make matters worse, I have to act for them.
Most of the time, my round, red face and my blond
braids eliminate me at the start. If they don&rsquo;t, I then
have to go through an audition reading. I&rsquo;m just waiting
for a casting notice that asks for a new actress
with a face like a Campbell&rsquo;s Soup kid, and I&rsquo;ll rush
right up and get the part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever meet any playwrights, I&rsquo;ll put in a word
for a part like that,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;But by then, you&rsquo;ll
be famous, and the &lsquo;new actress&rsquo; part would disqualify
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When breakfast was over, the girls scraped the
dishes, put them in the sink for Aniko, and went their
separate ways.</p>
<p>Gaby was off first, for an early English class at a
language school, which would be followed by a full
day at Columbia University studying English literature,
American history, economics, and a special
course called Literature of the Theater. With a small
&ldquo;<i>au revoir</i>,&rdquo; which was all she had said since her first
quiet &ldquo;<i>bon jour</i>,&rdquo; she slipped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaby&rsquo;s a night person,&rdquo; Dot explained. &ldquo;You can
hardly get a word out of her until sunset. Then you&rsquo;re
lucky if you can keep her quiet for five minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; Peggy asked. &ldquo;Are you a night
person, or a morning person?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must be a twenty-four-hour person.&rdquo; Dot
laughed. &ldquo;I work on stage until eleven-fifteen, but it
doesn&rsquo;t keep me from getting up as if I were on a
farm. I have to, though. I have a busy day. We rehearse
three days a week, just to keep the chorus
work tight, and I have special rehearsals for my understudy
part. It keeps me going nearly every day
from nine in the morning until after midnight, but I
seem to thrive on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta left for her office, to put in a day of script
editing (whatever that is, Peggy thought), Irene
went upstairs to &ldquo;put herself together&rdquo; for a photo
shooting to take place later in the morning, and Maggie
went off to a rehearsal studio to practice her
stretches and scales. Amy and Peggy sat alone in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Peggy asked. &ldquo;I feel so useless
having no program, and we sure can&rsquo;t spend the day
sitting here in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go out for a walk, and learn something
about the neighborhood?&rdquo; Amy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! In fact, why don&rsquo;t we find a sight-seeing
bus and take a ride around the city? My father
said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did mine!&rdquo; Amy interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;We get more alike every minute!&rdquo; Peggy said,
grinning. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up, put our things away, and go
out to learn all about New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Later that afternoon, sipping her first cup of Automat
coffee, Peggy slipped her shoes off under the
table and sighed, &ldquo;I certainly had a lot to learn when
I said we&rsquo;d go out and learn all about New York! My
feet are killing me, and we haven&rsquo;t even begun to see
the city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a lot, though,&rdquo; Amy replied thoughtfully.
&ldquo;We saw Chinatown and Greenwich Village and the
Lower East Side and Riverside Drive and Park Avenue
and Central Park and Sutton Place and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither of us could find our way back to any
one of them unless we took a sight-seeing bus again!&rdquo;
Peggy said. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve hardly begun! I&rsquo;ve been
checking off where we&rsquo;ve been on my city map and
guidebook, and we haven&rsquo;t seen anything but the
sights the guides think are picturesque! I saw loads
of places that we just shot by that I&rsquo;d love to go
back and explore when we have time; and the guidebook
lists hundreds of things that we didn&rsquo;t even
come near! Did you know that there are Italian street
festivals, and an Indian mosque, and a Spanish museum,
and shops that sell nothing but cheeses from
every country in the world, and an Armenian district,
and a Greek one, and Russian restaurants, and
Japanese, and French and German and Turkish and
Mexican and....&rdquo; She ran out of breath and stopped,
eyes shining with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;You make it sound
like a World&rsquo;s Fair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is. It&rsquo;s the biggest permanent World&rsquo;s Fair
anywhere, and we have a chance to see it without
anything to take our minds off it from now until
school starts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your energy just scares me,&rdquo; Amy said in a make-believe
little-girl voice, accentuating her Southern
drawl. &ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll just have to carry li&rsquo;l ol&rsquo;
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to do the carrying,&rdquo; Peggy
retorted, &ldquo;unless I can get these shoes back on! I
think all the walking we&rsquo;ve done has made my feet
three sizes larger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensibly, they finished the day&rsquo;s excursion with a
Fifth Avenue bus ride downtown.</p>
<p class="tb">The next few days until the Academy opened were
a round of sight-seeing, eating exotic foods in the restaurants
of many lands that Peggy had only started
to enumerate, and shopping in the famous stores.</p>
<p>The shopping expeditions were among the most
exciting things that Peggy and Amy did. The huge
stores, crammed with merchandise from all over the
world, were like nothing that they had ever seen
before. Even the afternoon that Peggy had spent
window-shopping with her mother had failed to prepare
her for the size and complexity of these shops.
Everywhere were rows on rows of dresses, coats,
skirts, blouses, robes, and gowns. Counters and showcases
displayed incredible arrays of lingerie, purses,
shoes, gloves, scarves, and other accessories. And
everywhere, at every time of day, the crowds of shoppers
clustered as thick as bees around a hive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Beautifully dressed women in furs walked side by
side with trim young secretaries and vied with them
for bargains at sales counters. Embarrassed men
sidled past lingerie departments in search of gifts for
their wives and sweethearts; short, stout women admired
dresses designed for tall, slim models; elderly
ladies tried on hat after hat, each one looking less
suitable than the last; girls sprayed themselves with
perfume at the cosmetic counters, or stood and
watched demonstrators at work. One demonstrator
who especially fascinated Peggy was a beautiful girl
with long blond hair, who was showing a new hairstyling
spray. She would spray it on, and with a few
expert flips of a comb, create a hairdo; then, combing
it out again, she would quickly arrange it in a different
style. Each one took her only a minute or so to
make perfect, then, out it would come, more spray
would be applied, and another coiffure would be
combed in. Peggy wondered how she wore it when it
was time to go home at night. Probably pulled back
in a bun, she thought.</p>
<p>These shopping tours represented diversion as
much as necessity, though in the course of visiting all
the stores, the girls did buy what they needed. Peggy
got several dresses, some skirts and sweaters, a new
coat, shoes, bag, and a hat. Also, on Amy&rsquo;s advice, she
bought some school things that would be suitable for
stage work, plus a leotard, tights and ballet shoes that
Mr. Macaulay&rsquo;s secretary had told her she would
need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>When neither girl could think of anything else that
she needed to buy, the temptation to revisit the
stores just to see things was still great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better not, though,&rdquo; Peggy said sensibly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m strong enough to resist temptation,
and I&rsquo;ve just about used up all my clothing allowance.
Let&rsquo;s visit some museums next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; Amy sighed. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a good
idea, all right, but I just wish school would hurry up
and start. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to get indigestion from
swallowing all of New York in one big gulp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So did Peggy, but museums were on her &ldquo;little
list,&rdquo; and museums it would be. Besides, she knew
that once school began, she would have little time
for anything else.</p>
<p>So the guidebook came out once more, together
with the flat walking shoes. But, though their time
was spent in museums, their minds were in the future,
and their talk was of nothing but the Academy,
which was due to open in a few short days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>First Act</i></span></h2>
<p>Peggy and Amy thought they had arrived early for
opening day at the New York Dramatic Academy,
but when they entered the old building, they found
the long hallway filled to capacity with students
waiting their turn on the ancient elevators.</p>
<p>Some obviously new students milled around aimlessly,
looking somewhat lost and more than a little
frightened. Peggy wondered if she and Amy looked
the same, and made a determined effort to appear at
ease and knowing. But her pose couldn&rsquo;t have been
very convincing, for a small, thin boy with huge
glasses and a shock of black hair came over to them
with a grin and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re new, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;Do we show it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not at all,&rdquo; he assured them earnestly.
&ldquo;You look just fine. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been here two
years, and I know everyone. I&rsquo;m Pete Piper, but
everyone calls me Pip. I just thought I&rsquo;d help lead
you through the maze, if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Amy introduced themselves, and
thanked Pip for his help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everybody does
it. Whenever we see new students on the first day,
the old-timers introduce themselves and offer to help.
It&rsquo;s kind of a custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking around, Peggy noticed that the &ldquo;lost
lambs&rdquo; she had first seen were by now in conversation
with other, older students, and all of them
looked a good deal more relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a lovely custom,&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;It makes
our Southern Hospitality look right cold by comparison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, it was their turn at the elevator
doors, which suddenly flew open with their usual
wail of protest. Peggy, Amy, and Pip were almost
carried in, with no need to walk at all, by the mass
of students around them, and soon were packed as
tight as berries in a basket. Protesting loudly, the
elevator slowly ascended.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the halls which had been nearly empty
when Peggy had last seen them were now swarming
with students. The ones who seemed to know where
they were going swirled and eddied around others
who looked around doubtfully and hesitated to go
anywhere.</p>
<p>Pip shook his head and said, &ldquo;More waifs and
strays up here, I see. I&rsquo;ll set you on your way, and
then gather up a new crop. You just go right into
the little theater&mdash;ahead of you, through those doors&mdash;and
take seats. From there on, you&rsquo;ll be told what
to do and where to go. I&rsquo;ll see you around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>He started off to gather a new group of first-term
students, but before he had taken more than three
steps, he was back again. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have lunch together
with some of the others,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That okay with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; the girls chorused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Meet you downstairs in front of the building
at twelve. S&rsquo;long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling no longer lost, but already a part of their
new school community, Peggy and Amy proceeded
into the little theater, found seats near the front, and
started to introduce themselves to the other new
students nearest them. The exchange of names, home
towns, impressions, and ambitions occupied the next
fifteen minutes or more until the dimming of the
house lights and the illumination of the stage
brought a hush to the small auditorium.</p>
<p>The last few whispers died when Mr. Macaulay
walked to stage center, bowed formally to the right,
the left and the center, and then unexpectedly sat
down on the apron of the stage with his legs dangling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bows were your formal welcome to the Academy,
and I hope they take the place of a speech,&rdquo;
Mr. Macaulay began. &ldquo;I hate speeches. From now on,
we&rsquo;re going to be informal and friendly, because
that&rsquo;s the only atmosphere in which people can get
any work done. And you have a lot of work to do.
You will have physical work in which you will learn
to walk, to move, to dance a little, to stand up and to
sit down. You may think you already know how to do
these things, but you probably don&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will have mental work,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;in
which you will learn how to read a play, how to understand
the motivation of a character and his relationship
to the other characters. You will learn
elocution, voice projection, and a dozen other things
that have to do with speaking lines. You will learn
the history of the theater, become familiar with the
classic plays, and learn something about stage design
and construction. In this last area, you will pick
up the practical craft of making flats, painting scenery,
and wiring lighting&mdash;a type of pedestrian work
that has occupied the time of nearly every actor before
he was allowed to appear even in a walk-on role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last, and perhaps most important,&rdquo; Mr. Macaulay
concluded, &ldquo;you will learn that the informality
and friendliness of the theater must not be mistaken
for lack of discipline; in short, you will learn how to
take direction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still seated on the edge of the stage, Mr. Macaulay
called out his staff of instructors one by one, introduced
each to the students, and gave a short history
of each one&rsquo;s background and qualifications for his
or her work. All were seasoned professionals, and
were very impressive to the students.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Mr. Macaulay also explained that leading performers
from the Broadway stage, movies, and television
would make regular guest appearances at the
Academy, as would outstanding directors, choreographers,
designers, and playwrights. The size of the
staff, in effect, was unlimited.</p>
<p>After this, the individual instructors spoke, each
saying a few words about his specialty and what he
hoped to achieve in his course. Each one, it seemed
to Peggy, opened up whole new areas of knowledge
for her, until at the end she felt that she knew absolutely
nothing at all, and wondered how she could
ever have thought of herself as an actress. This was
going to take a lot of work!</p>
<p>After the meeting, the rest of the morning was
spent in the routine of registration, getting class
cards, finding out where the rooms were, getting
locker assignments and book lists and, bit by bit,
eliminating the first sense of confusion.</p>
<p>Peggy and Amy, happily, were registered in the
same class, and went together through the busy
morning. Before they knew it, it was time for lunch
with Pip Piper and &ldquo;some of the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others proved to be Connie Barnes, a cheerful
comedienne who managed to be wonderfully attractive
without being in the least pretty, and a dark,
muscular, tough-looking young man with a face like
either a private detective or a gangster in a grade-B
movie, who was introduced by Pip as Mallory Seton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Much to Peggy&rsquo;s surprise, when he spoke it was
not at all the tough, New York sound she had expected,
but a quiet, cultured English accent. &ldquo;Call
me Mal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mallory&rsquo;s rather a mouthful, isn&rsquo;t
it? At least, it seems so here. At home, they used to
call me &lsquo;Mallory John&rsquo; all the time, so as not to confuse
me with my father, who is named &lsquo;Mallory
Peter,&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone in America doing
that. If I&rsquo;d been brought up here, I&rsquo;d probably have
been called &lsquo;Bud.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Pip, the students walked around the
corner to stop in front of a narrow delicatessen store.
The sign on the window said, &ldquo;Tables in the rear,&rdquo;
but Peggy could see from the crowd that clustered
at the counter that there would be no chance of getting
one. And besides, the place didn&rsquo;t look wide
enough to hold a table that would seat the five of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to
be able to eat here, there are so many of us. Perhaps
if Amy and I went somewhere else, you three would
have a chance? We don&rsquo;t want to make it difficult for
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Pip cut in. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expect to
get a table here. You&rsquo;re lucky if you can get a seat at
the counter for one, much less a table for more than
one. We&rsquo;re going to buy sandwiches here and take
them to the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipping out a notebook, Pip started to take orders
and money, with frequent reference to the
menu pasted to the delicatessen window. Then he
plunged into the place and, in less time than Peggy
thought possible, was back with a giant bag full of
sandwiches and cold, bottled drinks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It was only two blocks to the southern boundary of
Central Park, and once they had crossed Fifty-ninth
Street and stepped into the tree-shaded, winding
footpath, the city seemed to disappear behind them
as if it had never been. At the foot of the first gentle
hill, there was a small lake bordered by a bench-lined
path. There were some empty benches, but
Pip ignored them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind walking a little farther,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we have a favorite spot on the opposite shore,
where hardly anyone ever comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path brought them across a small arched footbridge,
through a thick copse, and out alongside a
broad lawn which ran down to the lake&rsquo;s shore. It
was here that they chose to eat, sitting on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re comfortably settled,&rdquo; Mal said, &ldquo;I
have some great news for you, but first I think we
ought to tell Peggy and Amy what we&rsquo;re talking
about, so they won&rsquo;t feel left out of the conversation.
Connie, you tell them about the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Connie,&rdquo; Pip interrupted. Then he
turned to the newcomers. &ldquo;Do you know what the
term &lsquo;Off-Broadway&rsquo; means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I think so,&rdquo; Peggy replied. &ldquo;It means
you&rsquo;re not using one of the regular, big theaters, and
you charge less admission, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; Pip broke in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s generally an
experimental group&mdash;though that doesn&rsquo;t mean necessarily
that it&rsquo;s amateur, and one thing you can be
sure of&mdash;it never has enough money. Everybody has
to do a little of everything. Now go on, Connie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the three of us are in that kind of group,&rdquo;
Connie started, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re trying to produce a play
off-Broadway. We&rsquo;ve been working at it for about
six months now, trying to raise the money and get a
theater and do all the rest of the work that goes into
these things. The play is called <i>Lullaby</i>, and it&rsquo;s
terrific, or it will be if it ever gets produced. Mal&rsquo;s
going to direct it, and I&rsquo;m already cast as the comedienne,
and Pip plays opposite me. There are a few
more of us in it too, of course, and there&rsquo;s Randy
Brewster, who wrote it and is producing it. But I
want to hear the great news before I talk any more.
What is it, Mal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be a shock,&rdquo; Mal said, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll
say it very slowly. Randy has raised almost all the
money we need, and he&rsquo;ll have the rest in a few days.
It looks as if we&rsquo;re actually going to get this on the
boards this season&mdash;if we can find a theater for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Connie breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Pip exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did he get the money? What happened?
Do you know?&rdquo; Connie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the reading we did at that Park
Avenue penthouse a couple of months ago?&rdquo; Mal
asked. &ldquo;The one where all the people seemed so cold
and hostile, and we felt that we had made a miserable
botch of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; Connie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mal said, his tough features composing
themselves into a broad grin, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an Americanism, Mal,&rdquo; Pip said eagerly,
&ldquo;and it means &lsquo;tell me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would never have guessed,&rdquo; Mal said innocently.
&ldquo;Well, that was the reading that did it.
Actually, those penthouse people weren&rsquo;t hostile at
all. It&rsquo;s just what they consider good manners or
something. Anyway, several of them came through,
and we have almost all we need to put the play on.
And Randy says that once you have most of the
money, it gives other investors confidence, and they
come along, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you need?&rdquo; Peggy asked. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t think it would take so very much to do an
off-Broadway play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were the good old days,&rdquo; Pip said mournfully.
&ldquo;Nowadays you need at least ten thousand
dollars, which is still practically nothing compared
to what it costs to put a show on Broadway. You have
to pay high rent for theaters now, if you can find one
at all, and you have to spend money on costumes
and sets, because the public expects more from off-Broadway
than they used to. And you have to pay
your actors, or else Equity, which is the actors&rsquo; union,
won&rsquo;t let you open. And you have to advertise, and
print tickets, and pay for lighting equipment and a
hundred other things. It all adds up to a lot of cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the backers have a chance of making
money?&rdquo; Amy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all depends on the type of theater we can
find, and on the critical reviews of the play,&rdquo; Mal
explained. &ldquo;If the reviews are good, and if the theater
holds enough people, and if they keep coming
for long enough, there&rsquo;s a chance. If any one of those
factors is lacking, then there isn&rsquo;t a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the play about?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>Connie frowned and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of hard to
answer. It&rsquo;s a comedy, but at the same time it&rsquo;s a
serious play. I mean it&rsquo;s serious in what it talks about,
but funny in the way it says it. It&rsquo;s mostly about a
boy genius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; Pip interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;who feels that the only way to get along in the
world is not to let people know how smart he is, because
people are jealous and suspicious of people
who are too smart. He meets a girl genius&mdash;that&rsquo;s me&mdash;who
has come to the same conclusion. Both of
them try to act like ordinary people, and to adjust to
the world, because everybody says it&rsquo;s best to conform
and be just like everybody else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of the main problems is that neither one
of them wants to let the other one know that he or
she is any different,&rdquo; Pip interrupted, &ldquo;and that leads
to a lot of misunderstanding and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot of serious discussion under the comedy,&rdquo;
Mal said, &ldquo;about whether or not conformity
is any good, and what to do with outstanding people,
and how they can be educated, and how to use them
properly in the world. It&rsquo;s a really first-rate play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds wonderful!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Has this
Randy Brewster written any other plays? Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Randy has written lots of others,&rdquo; Mal answered,
&ldquo;but this is the first one that looks as if it&rsquo;s going to
be produced. He&rsquo;s a good playwright, and I think
he&rsquo;s going to be a success. At least I hope so, because
if the play is well received, we all have a chance of
success too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do besides write plays?&rdquo; asked
Amy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dancer and a singer,&rdquo; Connie said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been working in night clubs and on television, and
he&rsquo;s good, but he has a real talent as a writer, and
we all agree that he&rsquo;s wasted as just another song-and-dance
man. If you want to see him, you can
tune in to your television set on Saturday night. He&rsquo;s
got a spot on the Road Show hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a television set,&rdquo; Peggy answered,
&ldquo;though I guess I could find one to watch, but I&rsquo;d
like to do more than look in on this via TV. Is there
anything I could do to help with the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well....&rdquo; Mal began doubtfully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re almost
all cast for it now, and the few parts that are open
aren&rsquo;t exactly your type&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to ask for a
part! Why, I&rsquo;m just beginning here, and I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;d be good enough at all! No, I meant that if you
need an extra pair of hands to make costumes, or to
paint flats or to sell space in the theater program,
I&rsquo;m volunteering. I&rsquo;ll run errands, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; Amy put in. &ldquo;Can you use a pair of
maids-of-all-work?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;We sure can!&rdquo; Connie said eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
hardest kind of people to find. I&rsquo;m certainly glad that
Pip thought to ask you two to lunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mal looked quite relieved to find that he was not
to be put in the position of having to refuse more
actresses. Since word about the project had first gotten
out around the Academy, he had been besieged
with students who wanted to be in it, and the work
of casting and at the same time not hurting the feelings
of friends had been pretty difficult.</p>
<p>As they strolled back to the Academy, Mal told the
girls that there was to be a meeting of the theater
group that evening at Connie&rsquo;s apartment, and invited
them to attend. &ldquo;I know that everybody will
be glad to meet you, and you&rsquo;ll get a chance to read
the play and to find out what we&rsquo;re up against in
trying to produce it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving their new friends in the school corridor,
Amy and Peggy went off to their first elocution
class, feeling as if they were really a part of the
Academy and the new life around them, and looking
forward eagerly to the meeting at Connie&rsquo;s that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Theater Party</i></span></h2>
<p>Connie&rsquo;s apartment was not the easiest place to find,
but she had given detailed instructions, even to drawing
a little map on a paper napkin, and after only a
few wrong turnings, Peggy and Amy found themselves
that night at a low pink door set in a high brick
wall on a winding street in Greenwich Village. They
pushed the button marked &ldquo;Barnes-Lewis,&rdquo; and soon
an answering buzz let them know that the door was
unlocked.</p>
<p>Pushing it open, they entered, not a house, but a
narrow alley between two buildings. Along one wall
was a bed of flowers and green borders, and hidden
among them were small floodlights which gave a
gentle, guiding glow. At its end, the alley opened
into a little courtyard with a small fountain and a
statue of a nymph surrounded by canvas lawn chairs.
Fronting on it was an old, low, white-brick house, its
door opened wide. Connie came out to greet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you didn&rsquo;t have any trouble finding our
hideaway,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must be a good map-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Tactfully refraining from telling her about the
wrong turns, Peggy and Amy agreed with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful place you have here!&rdquo; Peggy
said. &ldquo;However did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; Connie said. &ldquo;I found Linda
Lewis, my roommate, which was a good deal easier.
She was already living here, and when her roommate
got married, she asked me if I&rsquo;d move in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did she find it?&rdquo; Amy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same way,&rdquo; Connie laughed. &ldquo;These places get
passed along from friend to friend. You could hunt
for apartments every day for a year and never even
see a place like this. You just have to know somebody,
or be lucky. I&rsquo;d hate to show you the miserable
place I lived in before I moved in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rdquo; proved to be a spacious room with an extraordinarily
high ceiling and a fireplace with a tremendous
copper hood. An open stairway mounted
up one wall to a landing, then turned a corner and
went up again. The only other room downstairs was
a kitchen. Upstairs were two bedrooms and a bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whole house,&rdquo; Connie explained. &ldquo;It
used to be a carriage house for one of the big places
on the street, before all the big places were turned
into apartments. Now come on in and meet everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Linda Lewis, Connie&rsquo;s roommate, rose from the
piano bench to greet the girls. She had apparently
been playing until the bell had announced their arrival.
Linda was a tall, slim, rather plain girl with a
sweet smile who was a music student at Juilliard,
considered by most people to be the best music
school in the country. She greeted them shyly, and
returned to her place at the keyboard, where she began
playing quietly, as if to herself.</p>
<p>Pip rose from his seat on the raised hearth of the
fireplace to greet them and to introduce them to
his companion, a striking woman in her mid-thirties.
&ldquo;This is Mona Downs. She&rsquo;s in the play, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they had a chance to do more than say
hello, Connie was introducing them to the last person
in the room, a handsome middle-aged man with
curly dark hair that had turned completely white at
the temples. His name was Thomas Galen, and he,
too, was a member of the cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s terribly tactless of me,&rdquo; Peggy said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mean it that way at all. It&rsquo;s just that I always
thought that these off-Broadway plays were
done entirely by students or&mdash;or&mdash;very young actors
and actresses. I mean....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mona Downs laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel embarrassed to
talk about our advanced ages. We aren&rsquo;t supposed
to look like fresh young things!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Tom Galen smiled in agreement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here because
Randy needed some actors for the more mature
parts, and we were lucky enough to be picked.
The off-Broadway plays are a good showcase for experienced
actors, too, you know. Take me, for instance&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
been acting for a good many years now,
but I&rsquo;ve never had any really good vehicles. I&rsquo;ve
made a living on supporting roles and road shows,
and I&rsquo;ve even played some good leads in stock, but
somehow I&rsquo;ve never quite hit it. Maybe I&rsquo;m not good
enough, but on the other hand, I may just not have
had the breaks. These off-Broadway shows nowadays
are seen by all the top critics in New York, and
if I do a good job, and if they like the play, I have a
chance to go on to a whole new kind of career. That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;m here, and that&rsquo;s why Mona is here. Besides,
you can&rsquo;t do a believable show with just young actors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Peggy nodded. &ldquo;And I hope you didn&rsquo;t
mind my mentioning it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before Tom Galen or Mona Downs had a
chance to reassure her again, the buzzer rang, and
they broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Randy and Mal,&rdquo; Connie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed the button to unlock the gate, and
opened the front door expectantly. A few seconds
later, Mal entered with a tall, grinning, engaging-looking
young man with flaming red hair. For a moment,
everyone seemed to be talking at once. Randy
and Mal were apologizing for being late; Connie was
saying that they weren&rsquo;t late at all; Pip was trying
to get Randy away to introduce him to Amy and
Peggy; Mona and Tom were asking him about the
financing he had managed to get for the show, and
Linda was playing &ldquo;Hail the Conquering Hero&rdquo; in
loud, solid chords.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>When the initial excitement had died down and
the last resounding notes of the piano had quieted,
Randy Brewster was introduced to Peggy and Amy
by an excited Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having all the luck today!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You come up with the backing for the play, and Pip
discovers these two wonderful girls who want to be
beasts of burden for the show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two prettiest beasts in New York, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
Randy said with a smile, and Peggy was positive
that she was blushing, though she tried her hardest
not to. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful for your interest,&rdquo; Randy continued,
&ldquo;and I only hope that we have a chance to use
your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, now that you&rsquo;ve raised the money, isn&rsquo;t it
certain that the play will be produced?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a better chance today than we had
yesterday,&rdquo; Randy explained, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s far from a sure
thing yet. You see, we have the central problem now
of trying to find a theater we can use. And I&rsquo;m
afraid that&rsquo;s going to prove to be a harder job than
raising the money, or even than writing the play in
the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mal and Pip and Connie mentioned the problem
of finding a theater a few times today,&rdquo; Peggy said,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know it was as serious as all that. Why
should there be such a shortage?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a lot of reasons,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s a shortage even on Broadway&mdash;maybe even a
worse one. Forty years ago, there were more than
twice the number of theaters in New York than there
are now, and every year we lose a few more. One
reason is the fire laws that make it illegal to have a
theater with anything built over it. In other words,
you can&rsquo;t have a Broadway theater on the lower
floors of an office building; and with real-estate values
as high as they are in Manhattan, it just isn&rsquo;t profitable
to use up all the space a theater takes without
building high up as well. Off-Broadway rules are a
little easier, but the downtown theater has become
so popular that everybody and his brother wants to
put on a play off-Broadway, and all the available
theaters are booked way in advance. Not only that,
but dramatic groups have rented almost all the
places that can be converted to theaters, and there
don&rsquo;t seem to be any left for us.&rdquo; Then, breaking his
serious expression with a sudden grin, he said, &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t let it worry you. I&rsquo;m trusting to luck that we&rsquo;ll
find something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope luck does it,&rdquo; Peggy said doubtfully, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;d prefer to trust in something a little more trustworthy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any ideas, I&rsquo;ll be happy to hear them,&rdquo;
Randy said, &ldquo;but right now, we&rsquo;d better get on with
this evening&rsquo;s meeting and reading. I&rsquo;ll talk to you
over sandwiches and coffee afterward, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy delightedly accepted, then found herself a
seat with Amy out of the way to watch the proceedings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>First, Randy told the assembled group about the
investment in the play, and about his hopes for the
small remaining amount they would need. Then,
having completed his report, he turned the evening
over to Mallory Seton, who immediately began the
readings with an authority and toughness that went
well with his rugged face.</p>
<p>Peggy observed carefully how Mal would interrupt
one or another of the actors, acting out a line
for him or her, or asking for a somewhat different
emphasis. Sometimes a small change in timing or
inflection would turn an ordinary line into an unexpectedly
comic one, and Peggy and Amy laughed
aloud several times.</p>
<p>Randy followed with his master script, every so
often stopping the action to make a change in dialogue.
&ldquo;Sometimes a thing sounds fine when you
write it, but it just doesn&rsquo;t read well,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the main purposes of these early readings&mdash;to
let me have a chance to hear what I&rsquo;ve
written and see if it plays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other changes were made at the suggestion of one
or another of the cast, who found a line unnatural to
say, or somehow uncomfortable or out of character.
Randy listened to every suggestion, and took most
of them, but on one or two occasions he insisted that
the actors accommodate themselves to what he had
written.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Peggy was fascinated by the whole process, and
particularly appreciated the air of good will with
which changes in script, style of reading, and interpretation
of character were made. This was a company
of willing, hard-working friends, and they were
already molding the play in a joint effort. She was
sure that they would be successful.</p>
<p>At last the readings for the evening were completed,
and people started to say good night. Randy
brought Mal with him and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come
along for coffee and a sandwich with us? Peggy seems
to have some ideas about the theater problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Peggy disclaimed. &ldquo;Not really! I was
just wondering if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wonder over coffee,&rdquo; Mal cut in. &ldquo;Come on,
Amy. Let them talk about the theater, and we can
talk about you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few blocks&rsquo; walk brought the four of them to
a coffee shop where, seated around a tiny marble-topped
table, they studied the menu. To Peggy and
Amy it was a revelation. There were over twenty
kinds of coffee offered, most of which they had
never heard of, plus dozens of exotic pastries and
sandwiches. They finally settled, on Randy&rsquo;s advice,
on <i>cappuccino</i>, which proved to be coffee flavored
with cinnamon and topped with a froth of milk, and
which was perfectly delicious. With it, they had an
assortment of <i>amaretti</i>&mdash;hard, sweet Italian macaroons
that came wrapped in gaily decorated tissues,
and cornetti&mdash;pastry horns filled with some creamy
whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Randy said, when they were all served,
&ldquo;what did you have in mind about a theater for us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing at the moment,&rdquo; Peggy admitted,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m against the idea of just trusting to luck, the
way you said you were going to do. It seems to me
that some hard looking would get better results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, and I have been looking,&rdquo; Randy replied.
&ldquo;We have our names on the waiting lists of every
known off-Broadway theater in the city, and I call
regularly just to remind them that we&rsquo;re serious
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been looking around for a place that
you might convert to a theater, too?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave up on that. We found that it would cost
too much to do a decent conversion, and not only
that, but we&rsquo;d be in the real-estate business as well
as the play-producing business, and we don&rsquo;t want
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I see. Well, how
about all the theaters that you said used to be in
existence forty years ago? What&rsquo;s happened to all of
them? Maybe some of them are just sitting around
and not being used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re being used!&rdquo; Randy laughed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re being used as movie houses and television
studios and ice-skating rinks and churches and even
supermarkets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you looked at them all?&rdquo; Peggy pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well....&rdquo; Randy said, &ldquo;maybe not all, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do for you first!&rdquo;
Peggy announced with determination. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go look
at them all, and maybe I can find some usable place.
At least, I&rsquo;m willing to try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Peggy,&rdquo; Mal put in, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know anything
about New York at all! It&rsquo;s not like Rockport,
Wisconsin. It takes a lot of looking, and you have to
know where to look. How will you start?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="A few blocks&rsquo; walk brought the four of them to a coffee shop...." width="500" height="333" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just yet,&rdquo; Peggy answered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
think of a way. I used to help out as a reporter on
my father&rsquo;s newspaper, and I&rsquo;m used to digging up
facts. If there&rsquo;s an empty theater in New York City,
I&rsquo;ll bet I know about it in a couple of weeks. If
there isn&rsquo;t one, I&rsquo;ll know that too, and at least that
will save the rest of you all the trouble of looking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Randy looked a little doubtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that you
mean what you say, and I don&rsquo;t doubt that you can
get things done as well as any of us, Peggy, but as
Mal said, New York isn&rsquo;t Rockport. And I don&rsquo;t mean
just that it&rsquo;s bigger. It&rsquo;s not a&mdash;well, a <i>nice</i> city in
every part. And a search like this can lead you into
some pretty tough parts of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;In the last two weeks,
I&rsquo;ll bet Amy and I have walked around more of
New York than either of you has in the last two
years! And that included some pretty tough-looking
neighborhoods, and nobody bothered us, and
everybody was very nice. I think that&rsquo;s a lot of
nonsense! Besides, we&rsquo;re big girls, and we can take
care of ourselves by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly can,&rdquo; Amy agreed. &ldquo;And I plan to
go, too, just the way I&rsquo;ve dragged my aching feet
after Peggy for two weeks now. That girl can cover
more territory in a morning than a Tennessee Walking
Horse can manage in a whole day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you really want to try, it&rsquo;s okay with me,&rdquo;
Randy said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m grateful to you for wanting to.
If you need any help along the way, be sure to ask
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can start by giving me a list of all the places
you&rsquo;ve gone to, so I won&rsquo;t waste my time, and I&rsquo;ll
take it from there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Randy promised to bring the list to the Academy
the next day, at which time, if it was okay with
Peggy and Amy, he would like to join them for lunch.
Then their interest turned to other things, including
more coffee for the girls and another huge sandwich
to be split between the boys.</p>
<p>By the time they had finished and walked to the
Gramercy Arms, it was nearly midnight. Peggy and
Amy whispered quiet good nights on the stairs, and
hurried up to bed. Tomorrow was school again, and
they needed all the sleep they could get.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Peggy Produces a Plot</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers; a
peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked; if Peter
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where&rsquo;s the
peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect peck of pickled peppers, Peggy,&rdquo; said
Miss Linden, the elocution instructor, &ldquo;except that
you picked them a trifle too quickly. That&rsquo;s the big
temptation of tongue twisters; you always want to
show that you can rip them out at great speed without
making a mistake. What I want you to do this
time is to say the same thing, but to concentrate on a
normal rate of delivery that will allow your voice to
carry to the rear of a hall without becoming blurred.
Distance, you know, tends to make sounds run together.
Now, Peggy, if you don&rsquo;t mind....&rdquo;</p>
<p>More slowly this time, and concentrating on making
her words reach the back of some huge, imaginary
hall, Peggy once more spoke the tongue twister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Much better. Much better,&rdquo; Miss Linden approved.
&ldquo;Now, John, will you please read &lsquo;round
and round the rugged rock the ragged rascals ran,&rsquo;
and try to read it as if it had a meaning, as if those
ragged rascals were at the end of their endurance,
as if you were one of them, almost. Make the words
clear, project them, and at the same time give me a
note of urgency and a feeling of near-exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John, a handsome boy whom Peggy had already
judged vain and stupid and who, she suspected, had
gone into acting on the strength of his appearance,
struggled with the assignment. Peggy tried to maintain
an interest in what he was doing, but her mind
was on her coming lunch meeting with Randy
Brewster.</p>
<p>What on earth was she going to suggest? Why
had she volunteered to undertake the search for a
theater with such confidence? It had been bothering
her since she had awakened this morning, and the
more she thought about it, the less likely it seemed
that she would come up with an idea worth pursuing.
Still, there must be some angle that Randy and
Mal hadn&rsquo;t thought of, some idea that would occur
to her, with her reporter&rsquo;s training, that had escaped
them. That all sounded very good, she commented to
herself, but what was the angle? Miss Linden&rsquo;s tongue
twisters were child&rsquo;s play compared to this puzzle.</p>
<p>Before her turn came to read again, it was time for
the elocution class to end and time to go, empty-headed,
to meet Randy. Peggy had never in her life
felt so stupid, nor so embarrassed, for having made
the boast last night that she could find what they
had missed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Amy, sensing the reason for Peggy&rsquo;s gloomy silence,
didn&rsquo;t question her about it. Without a word,
the two girls moved through the crowded corridor to
the elevators, rode downstairs, and stationed themselves
at the front door. Finally Peggy spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Amy, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a complete
fool! I like him so much, and I&rsquo;ve made him take this
special trip to bring me his list of theaters, and if I
don&rsquo;t come up with an idea that makes sense, I won&rsquo;t
blame him for thinking I&rsquo;m a dope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to find a theater or a boy friend?&rdquo;
Amy asked with a sly smile.</p>
<p>Blushing, Peggy stammered, &ldquo;Why, Amy, I ...
I just met him last night ... the same as you ...
and ... Oh dear! Here he comes now, and I look
like an embarrassed lobster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Amy said with a laugh, &ldquo;with his
red hair and your red face, you make a lovely couple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Peggy could answer, Randy had reached
them and either did not notice, or gallantly pretended
not to notice Peggy&rsquo;s confusion. He greeted
them with a smile, and gaily waved a large paper
bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the liberty of ordering for you, ladies,&rdquo; he
announced in the manner of a musical-comedy headwaiter.
&ldquo;The caviar, <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</i>, and pheasant
under glass are not of the best quality today, so I
decided instead to get ham on rye, pickles, and
potato chips. I also have two cartons of milk of a
superior vintage. We dine on the terrace by the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In the laughter, Peggy regained her self-possession,
and the three of them started for the park
where, Randy told them, they would be joined by
Pip and Connie.</p>
<p>At the mention of Pip, Amy said, &ldquo;I was wondering
how, with a name like Peter Piper, Pip ever got
through that tongue-twister stuff. It must have been
terrible for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him to do it for you sometime,&rdquo; Randy replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s learned that the best defense is a good
offense, so long before he came to the Academy he
had that one perfected. He can do Peter Piper in
any accent or dialect you ask, and can even do it in a
rapid-fire stutter! It&rsquo;s funny enough so that nobody
ever kidded him about it. In fact, he&rsquo;s got it worked
up into part of a first-rate comedy bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their arrival at the lawn by the lake, they
found that Randy had brought a large paper table-cloth
and some oversized paper napkins for the girls
to sit on. As she helped set out the lunch, Peggy was
impressed by this extra display of thoughtfulness,
and felt that she had been right in thinking Randy
Brewster was a special kind of person. She had just
finished setting the &ldquo;table&rdquo; when Connie and Pip
joined them and added their own lunches to the
spread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>When they were all settled comfortably, Randy
opened the conversation with the question that
Peggy had been fearing all morning. &ldquo;Well, Peggy, I
brought the list of theaters we&rsquo;ve seen, and now will
you tell us what you have in mind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6.jpg" alt="When they were all settled comfortably...." width="500" height="484" />
</div>
<p>Much to her surprise, Peggy found herself answering
as smoothly as if she had known all along
what she was going to do. &ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;is to make use of all the city records. Since a
license is required to operate a theater, there must
be a list of all the places in the city that have been
licensed. I&rsquo;m going to go to City Hall, find the list,
and copy the names and addresses of every theater
that has been opened in the last fifty or sixty years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the city will let you see the records?&rdquo;
Connie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;They have to. Anything
in the city files that doesn&rsquo;t concern individuals
is a matter of public record. I learned that from my
father. He always said that the city or town archives
of any place were the best reference books a reporter
could want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that makes good sense, Peggy,&rdquo; Randy
commented. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s going to be a long list. What
are you going to do when you&rsquo;ve got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Peggy admitted, &ldquo;but I think the
best thing to do would be to cut the list down before
I start to work with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you wanted the
list of theaters we&rsquo;ve already visited, so you could
eliminate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. The next thing to do, I think,&rdquo; Peggy went
on, with a dreamlike feeling that she did not know at
all what she was going to say next, &ldquo;is to look up
theaters in the classified telephone book. All the ones
that are listed, I&rsquo;ll eliminate from my list, on the
theory that they&rsquo;re probably being used by somebody
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy, you&rsquo;re a smart girl,&rdquo; Pip said admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure are,&rdquo; Connie echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dispute that,&rdquo; Randy agreed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m still
a little puzzled. When you&rsquo;ve eliminated all the theaters
listed in the phone book from the theaters listed
by the license bureau, what will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ll have,&rdquo; Peggy said triumphantly, &ldquo;is a
record of all the places in New York that started out
to be theaters and aren&rsquo;t theaters now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;Then you and I will go
to visit all the addresses and see if any of the places
aren&rsquo;t being used, and if they&rsquo;re for rent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes a lot of sense,&rdquo; Randy admitted. &ldquo;But
you know, it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of work and a lot of
walking. And disappointment, too. You won&rsquo;t be able
to find even a trace of many of those theaters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; Peggy answered, &ldquo;we may
be able to find a hidden theater that nobody even
knows is there! And wouldn&rsquo;t that be grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it all now,&rdquo; Pip said in a hollow voice.
&ldquo;A huge, haunted opera house of a theater, its hangings
in tatters, its chandeliers covered with dust and
its stage peopled by the ghosts of players long gone!
There it sits, undiscovered, unknown, hiding behind
a Chinese restaurant just a block east of Broadway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease her, Pip,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;I think Peggy
has a good idea, and it would be a pity to discourage
her before she gives it a try. Maybe she won&rsquo;t find a
theater, but at least this is the most sensible way I&rsquo;ve
heard of yet to start looking for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little shamefaced, Pip said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to
tease. You know me; I always want to turn everything
into a comedy routine. But, seriously, I think
this makes sense and, Peggy, if you need any help
in tracking down places, you can count on me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>All the others chimed in their agreement, and
Peggy thought proudly, and with some surprise, that
she had gotten herself out of a spot quite well. At
least Randy didn&rsquo;t think she was a fool, and that
was something to be pleased about.</p>
<p>When lunch was finished, and the last crumbs had
been fed to the ducks, it was time to return to the
Academy. Peggy said good-by to Randy and went up
to her afternoon&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Only by dint of the most intense concentration on
the study of Elizabethan drama did Peggy keep her
attention from the theater-hunting problem. But the
minute the class was ended, all other thoughts fled
from her mind. &ldquo;Come on, Amy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading
for City Hall right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peggy,&rdquo; Amy said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to
count me out today. I didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d have
any plans, so I made a date to have a soda with Mallory
Seton. I&rsquo;ll go with you tomorrow, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you accused <i>me</i> of looking for a boy friend
instead of a theater!&rdquo; Peggy said with a grin. &ldquo;If
anybody around here should blush, I think it&rsquo;s you,
Amy Shelby Preston!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ah don&rsquo;t know what yo&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; about!&rdquo;
Amy said, in her best Southern belle manner. &ldquo;Mistah
Seton asked me to join him, an&rsquo; Ah scarcely
thought it would be ladylike to refuse the gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both girls dissolved into very unladylike giggles,
and Peggy made a dash for the elevator. &ldquo;See
you tonight,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Rehearsals</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;So. &rsquo;Ow marches the search for the theater, Peggee?&rdquo;
Gaby asked, bouncing into the living room at
the Gramercy Arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful,&rdquo; Peggy admitted, looking up at Gaby
from her position on the floor. She was surrounded
by scraps of paper, pencils, a classified telephone
directory, and several assorted notebooks, guidebooks,
and city maps. &ldquo;I think it would be easier to
list all the perfume shops in Paris than all the theaters
built in New York since the nineties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfume shops! Pouf!&rdquo; Gaby shrugged. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave so manee. Most of our perfume is export,
to Am&eacute;rique. But theaters! Oh! You would &rsquo;ave the
same trouble in Paree as you &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ere. So, <i>bonne
chance</i>; mean to &rsquo;ave the good luck.&rdquo; With a wave of
her hand she went upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little <i>bonne chance</i> is what I could use right
now,&rdquo; Peggy confessed to Greta, Maggie, and Amy,
who were disposed in various chairs with books and
magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can help you with?&rdquo; Maggie asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, Maggie. I&rsquo;m through the help stage.
Amy and I have spent every afternoon for the last
three days just trying to get a list of theaters from the
city archives. It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re not helpful down
there. Everybody has been just as nice as can be, but
nothing&rsquo;s easy to find. In the first place, all the records
aren&rsquo;t kept in one big handy book, or in a list or anything
simple. Oh, no! They&rsquo;re in dozens and dozens
of volumes marked by year, and we&rsquo;re trying to go
back about seventy years. Not only that, but the
books aren&rsquo;t separated by kinds of licenses, so that
you can&rsquo;t just get a volume of theater licenses. You
have to look at each page to see what&rsquo;s been licensed.
There are groceries and bakeries and amusement
parks and drugstores and hardware stores and livery
stables and saddlemakers and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least you&rsquo;ve gotten into the early years,
I see, if you&rsquo;re on livery stables and saddlemakers,&rdquo;
Greta commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think that it would be easier,&rdquo; Maggie murmured.
&ldquo;I mean, if you wanted to find out what year
the Ziegfeld Theater was licensed, for instance,
would you have to go through all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;They have an alphabetical
index by name, and you could go right to it.
But we don&rsquo;t know the names of the places we&rsquo;re
looking for, and that&rsquo;s what makes it so difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so ... what if the police needed to know,
for example, and they had to know really fast? Suppose
they wanted the names of all the theaters?
Would they have to do what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Maggie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peggy answered, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s one of the
things that makes this so frustrating. The Police Department
has all its own files, and the clerk who&rsquo;s
been helping us says that we could find out what we
want to know from them in no time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why...?&rdquo; Greta began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police files are for the use of the Police Department
for police business,&rdquo; Peggy interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been told that very emphatically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there aren&rsquo;t any exceptions,&rdquo; Amy added,
&ldquo;so poor Peggy and I have had to make our own police
files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; Peggy went on gloomily, &ldquo;is
the hours we&rsquo;ve had to work at it. The bureau closes
at four-thirty sharp, and isn&rsquo;t open on Saturday, and
we&rsquo;re busy with school all day long. Amy and I don&rsquo;t
finish with our last class until three o&rsquo;clock, and
then we make a mad dash downtown. That gives us
about an hour a day to go through the books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How close are you to finishing?&rdquo; Greta asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the happy part. We finished 1890 today,
and that&rsquo;s as far back as we&rsquo;re going to go, unless
this batch turns up nothing for us. Then, I suppose,
we&rsquo;ll try another ten years before we quit. My guess
is that anything built before 1880 wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
looking into anyway. If it were still standing, it would
probably be an old rat&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Maggie smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let May Berriman hear you
say anything like that. This beautiful old house that
we&rsquo;re living in was built in 1878, and it&rsquo;s hardly a
rat&rsquo;s nest! And you&rsquo;ve passed the house that Washington
Irving lived in, just a few blocks south of
here? It&rsquo;s still a fine-looking house, and I don&rsquo;t know
how old it is, but Washington Irving died in 1859,
so it&rsquo;s got to be a lot older than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Maggie!&rdquo; Peggy wailed. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t made
me feel the least bit better! I thought I had a logical
date to stop looking, and that made things easier
somehow. Now you&rsquo;ve opened up the whole thing
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t start to feel sorry for yourself yet,&rdquo;
Greta put in. &ldquo;You have a lot of work to do on the
theaters you&rsquo;ve found since 1890 before you start to
think further back. And you may find just what you
want in that list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope so,&rdquo; Peggy agreed, smiling wanly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll never find it by lying here and talking. I&rsquo;d
better get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;d better
do now is go upstairs and take a shower and fix
yourself up! Don&rsquo;t forget it&rsquo;s Friday night, we&rsquo;ve got
a date tonight, and you have a lot to do before the
boys come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Amy, it&rsquo;s still early, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Peggy asked.
Then, with a glance at the grandfather clock in the
corner, she gasped. &ldquo;Oh! Six o&rsquo;clock already and
they&rsquo;re coming at seven! And I haven&rsquo;t even begun!
Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Sweeping up all her papers, notebooks, and other
gear in a single gesture, she bounced out of the room
with Amy right behind her, protesting that she
hadn&rsquo;t realized herself how late it had grown, and
that she too had a lot to do to get ready, and....</p>
<p>But before she could finish her sentence, Peggy
had dropped her papers, grabbed a towel and bathrobe
and raced for the bathroom. With the door held
open the merest crack, Peggy peeped through, grinning
broadly at Amy, who stood in the hall still
apologizing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgiven,&rdquo; Peggy said impishly, &ldquo;but your
punishment for loafing and not watching the time
while I was working is that I get the bathroom first!&rdquo;
Then she quickly shut the door before her friend
could push her way through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; Amy called through the door. &ldquo;I
can always use the other one upstairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; Peggy answered with a laugh, &ldquo;if you
can figure a way to get Irene the Beautiful Model
out. She always goes in at six o&rsquo;clock, and it would
take an atomic bomb to get her out before seven!
You&rsquo;ll just have to wait for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any further conversation was made impossible by
the noise of the water running, and Amy resigned
herself with a philosophical sigh, telling herself that
it was probably better for Peggy to go first anyway,
because she always finished quickly, as if that made
a difference, which, of course, it did not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The timing, however, must have made sense in
some mysterious way, because both girls were ready
at precisely the same moment. It was at the exact instant
that the grandfather clock began to chime
softly that Amy and Peggy both stepped from their
rooms into the hall and said, in chorus, &ldquo;You look
lovely! How do I look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing at themselves, each girl whirled around
and showed herself to the other. Peggy&rsquo;s turn made a
wide sweep of her black taffeta dress with its black
satin cummerbund smartly making the most of her
trim figure. For this special occasion, her first real
date in New York, she had put her hair up and skillfully
used a little eye make-up. Her long, slender
neck was accentuated by a single string of pearls,
which were echoed by her tiny pearl earrings.</p>
<p>Amy had chosen to set off her pale, blond beauty
with a brocaded dress of dark, lustrous green that
seemed to add a green glint to her brown eyes. She
wore a delicate, flat gold necklace, small gold earrings
and a slim, antique gold bracelet set with semiprecious
stones.</p>
<p>As Peggy fastened a hook and eye for Amy (it was
located in that one spot that just cannot be reached),
the last notes of the clock sounded, followed immediately
by the sound of the doorbell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Randy and Mal now!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
all so prompt that it&rsquo;s hardly possible!&rdquo; She ran down
the stairs to answer the door, Amy at her heels, and
a few minutes later, the four were strolling down the
street arm in arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure look beautiful tonight&mdash;both of you,&rdquo;
Randy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that I decided to wear a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d have sent you right home to get
one,&rdquo; Peggy said firmly. &ldquo;And besides, you did say
that we should dress up for dinner and dancing.
That is, if you&rsquo;ll put up with me. I&rsquo;ve never danced
with a professional dancer before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not a dancer, really,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
hoofer. You know, tap and soft-shoe and a couple of
gestures and turns that make the customers think I
studied ballet. Mostly I dance just enough to carry
off the singing, so that the act will have a little movement.
I hate singers who just stand there and croon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you study singing?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not really a singer,&rdquo; Randy said with a
grin. &ldquo;I just sing enough so the customers won&rsquo;t notice
that I&rsquo;m not dancing well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see you work and make up my own
mind,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;When can I get a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an expression halfway between a smile and
a frown, Randy answered, &ldquo;I hope that you never
get a chance. I&rsquo;m not working now, and with any
luck, I won&rsquo;t have to do night-club work again.
I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write for the theater, and I
believe in the play we&rsquo;re doing now, so I&rsquo;ve turned
down all engagements until we get it produced. It
may be the break I need. I&rsquo;ve been able to put away
enough to live on for a while, so I don&rsquo;t need the
night clubs. If the play flops, though, I can always go
back to them, much as I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, I hope I never get a chance to see
your act, too,&rdquo; Peggy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sensible wish!&rdquo; Mal put in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it, and I
tell you, as a singer and dancer, Red Brewster&mdash;as
he bills himself&mdash;is a darn good playwright. I won&rsquo;t
say it&rsquo;s the worst night-club act in New York,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Randy interrupted cheerfully, &ldquo;but it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he makes a living at it,&rdquo; Amy protested, taking
the lighthearted insults a little too seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just proves an old contention of mine,&rdquo; Mal answered
airily, &ldquo;that the public has a lot more money
than taste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, they had reached Fourteenth Street,
a wide, busy thoroughfare bright with neon lights and
gaudy store windows crammed full of bargain merchandise.
It hardly looked the sort of neighborhood
to come to dressed as they were, and for a moment
Peggy had a feeling that Randy hadn&rsquo;t been joking
about coming without a tie. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;
she asked cautiously, not wanting to offend the boys.</p>
<p>Randy laughed. &ldquo;I wondered whether or not you
knew about Fourteenth Street. Since you&rsquo;re so deep
in the history of the theater, I thought that we&rsquo;d take
you right into some. This run-down street was once
the heart of the fashionable theater district!&rdquo; He
waved a hand to indicate the tawdry movie houses,
the corner hot-dog stands, the poolrooms, the pizza
places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo; Peggy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Randy answered solemnly. &ldquo;And the
funny thing is that this is far from being a bad neighborhood.
Especially when you compare it with some
of the places you&rsquo;ll be visiting in the next few days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that movie house?&rdquo; Mal said, pointing to
a place plastered with signs for a double horror
monster show. &ldquo;That was once the most famous
musical theater in the city. And the Irving Theater
over there was a great dramatic showcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are we here tonight?&rdquo; Amy asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To show you that, in the ashes of the past, a
good bit of the past still flourishes with no sign of
decay,&rdquo; Mal intoned dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means,&rdquo; Randy interpreted, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re here
to eat dinner at Luchow&rsquo;s, one of the best restaurants
in the city. It&rsquo;s German, not Chinese, and you pronounce
it with a German <i>ch</i> that sounds like a
cough, if you can. If you can&rsquo;t, you settle on &lsquo;Loo-shau&rsquo;s,&rsquo;
which most people do. It&rsquo;s been here since
the theater district was here, and it hasn&rsquo;t changed
at all through all these years. Diamond Jim Brady
and Lillian Russell and Tony Pastor ate here, and
tonight we&rsquo;re going to do the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bow and a flourish, Mal and Randy opened
the doors and led the girls into, not just a restaurant,
but another century and another world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Intermission</i></span></h2>
<p>Peggy had never seen anything like it! The tremendous,
high-ceilinged rooms paneled in darkly polished
brown wood led in a seemingly endless procession
from one to the other, connected by arch
after arch. In front of them, across the first room,
four steps mounted up to a kind of gallery, itself an
immense chamber that stretched back as far as one
could see. In the front of the gallery, near the steps,
a small, three-piece orchestra played Viennese waltz
music. Peggy noted with amusement that the three
musicians looked as old as the restaurant, almost as
if they had been playing ever since opening night.</p>
<p>To the right, an oversized archway connected the
room they were in with what appeared to be the central
room of the place, even higher and more glittering
than the others. Peggy&rsquo;s eyes mounted up toward
the ceiling, which appeared to be three or more
stories high, and she saw that it was a kind of old-fashioned
leaded glass skylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Another arch between the rooms contained the
largest ship model that she had ever seen. It was a
full-rigged ship and stood easily six feet high. Everything
here was on such a large scale! Even the beer
steins that stood all around on shelves high on the
paneled walls were immense. Some would easily hold
two quarts of beer.</p>
<p>Everywhere were waiters scurrying about between
the crowded tables, carrying trays loaded
to improbable heights with dishes, glasses, covered
serving vessels, baskets of bread, rolls, and cheeses.
The whole place glittered with hundreds of lights,
each caught and reflected in the tall mirrors, the
glassware and the polished wood.</p>
<p>And the noise! The many conversations, the clink
of silver on dishes, the rattle of glasses, the waltz
tunes of the small orchestra, all blended into one
happy, congenial roar.</p>
<p>Peggy and Amy stood dazzled by the sights and
sounds of Luchow&rsquo;s, and tried to get their bearings,
while Randy and Mal checked their reservations
with the headwaiter. Soon they were assigned by this
impressive personage to a lesser headwaiter whom
Peggy thought of as their guide. This gentleman,
beckoning them to follow, plunged into the jungle
of tables and, in a kind of safari fashion, they
tracked him through several rooms, up some steps to
a gallery like the one on which the band was playing,
and to a large round table by the rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It was not until they were seated that Peggy realized
that there was not an endless number of rooms,
but only about six. The illusion was caused by giant
mirrors on either wall, set in arched frames like the
arches that separated the rooms. Even so, it was the
biggest and busiest restaurant that either she or
Amy had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; Randy asked.
When Peggy replied with a smile and a bewildered
shake of her head, he continued, &ldquo;I know. It always
affects me that way, too, but I still love to come here.
This is what New York was really like in the Gay
Nineties, and they haven&rsquo;t changed a thing that they
didn&rsquo;t have to change. Even the lighting fixtures,&rdquo;
he pointed out, &ldquo;are the original gaslights, except
that they&rsquo;ve had to wire them for electricity. But the
best thing is&mdash;as it should be&mdash;the food. That hasn&rsquo;t
changed either. Let&rsquo;s order now, then we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The menu, Peggy thought, was of a size to match
the restaurant, and it was crammed with dishes she
had never heard of, most with German names, many
with British names. At Randy&rsquo;s suggestion, she let
him order her dinner, which was sauerbraten, the
house specialty. Amy, less adventurous about food,
settled for roast beef. Randy ordered a lobster for
himself, and Mal asked for roast larded saddle of
hare, which made Amy shudder a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like the idea of eating rabbits,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re such cute little things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mal grinned. &ldquo;If you once start to think like that,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have a hard time eating at all. Think
about all those cute lambs, and those nice, sweet-tempered
cows. And think about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do my best not to think about them,&rdquo; Amy interrupted,
&ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t stop, I&rsquo;m going to order
a vegetable dinner and have an awful time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, when the food came, she and Peggy consented
to try the hare, and were forced to agree that
it was one of the most delicious things they had ever
tasted. Amy also liked Peggy&rsquo;s sauerbraten, which
was a kind of sweet-and-sour pot roast of beef, done
in a rich brown gravy and served with potato dumplings
and red cabbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s an odd thing the way Americans
eat,&rdquo; Mal said between bites of the saddle of hare.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager that there are millions of people in this
country who have never eaten anything but beef and
pork and perhaps a bit of fish. And I don&rsquo;t mean poor
people, either. I found out on my first tours here that
there are many parts of the country where you can&rsquo;t
even get lamb or veal, and mutton is almost unheard
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very different in England?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>Randy answered before Mal had a chance to reply.
&ldquo;In England they eat things that would make the
average American turn pale with fright.&rdquo; He laughed.
&ldquo;They eat suet puddings and kidney pies and
chopped toad....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chopped toad!&rdquo; Amy almost shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all what it sounds,&rdquo; Mal explained in
his most British tones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a sort of a hamburger
thing, and it&rsquo;s not made of toads or anything
like toads. And, personally, I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is the food the reason why you left England?&rdquo;
Amy asked teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; Mal said with a smile. &ldquo;But not because
I didn&rsquo;t like it. I liked it well enough when I could
get it. The reason I left was that I wasn&rsquo;t able to
earn enough money to eat with any degree of regularity.
When I got a part with an American movie
company that was filming a picture in England, I
was asked to come back with them, and I jumped
at the chance. I made a few films in Hollywood,
and then I decided to come to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you leave pictures?&rdquo; Peggy asked. &ldquo;I
mean, if you were working, and if you were starting
to be an established actor, why did you come to the
Academy to study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like the roles I was being given,&rdquo; Mal
answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of my face, you know. I
look like a young thug, so I was given nothing but
young thug parts. But, when you come to think of
it, how many roles are there for young thugs with
English accents? Besides, I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the
whole of my life in cops-and-robbers films. I decided
that I should try the stage, where I might have a
chance to play a variety of roles. Also, I thought I
might like to direct. The trouble was that I had no
experience with stage technique, so I applied to the
Academy for a year of basic training. It was there
that I met Randy, who has given me my first chance
to direct, and now that I&rsquo;ve had a taste of it, I know
that&rsquo;s what I really want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to say that I&rsquo;ve given you a chance
to direct,&rdquo; Randy put in, &ldquo;but unless Peggy and
Amy can produce a theater, I&rsquo;m afraid that the
chance will be a strictly imaginary one. Which reminds
me, how are you girls doing with the search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy told him about the troubles they had encountered
in making up a list, and he nodded sympathetically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished with that part of it
now,&rdquo; she said in tones of relief, &ldquo;and we only have
to finish checking against the phone book before we
go out to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will you start?&rdquo; Randy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow afternoon, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
ought to be done with the telephone book by noon,
if we don&rsquo;t sleep the whole morning away as a result
of this heavy dinner. Then we can look in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;It looks as if the best
help we can give you is to see to it that you work off
this dinner so that you don&rsquo;t waste the morning in
sleep! What do you suggest, Mal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing,&rdquo; Mal said firmly. &ldquo;Best way to get rid
of the full feeling. But, unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t dance
on an empty stomach, so we&rsquo;d best order a sweet,
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls and Randy protested with groans, but
somehow managed to eat every scrap of the thin
pancakes with lingonberries that Mal ordered for
them. A final cup of coffee, and then it was time to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if my dress is going to split any minute!&rdquo;
Peggy whispered to Amy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able
to walk to the door, much less dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping out of Luchow&rsquo;s, leaving its noise, gaiety,
and glitter behind, was once more like making a
transition between worlds. Fourteenth Street, now
almost deserted, looked even sadder and more run-down
than before. The night lights in the windows
of the closed shops cast baleful gleams on the pavement;
the thin sound of a cheap dance band far off
lent its sad jazz beat to the relatively quiet night.
Peggy shivered a little in the first chill of autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like two different cities, in there and out
here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, isn&rsquo;t it, that the real
one is out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching her mood, Randy put a reassuring arm
about her shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two hundred different
cities,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the real one is wherever you
happen to be at the moment. So let&rsquo;s leave this one,
to make it unreal, and go uptown. By the time we
turn our backs on this, it will disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it did disappear, or nearly, in the sophisticated
decor and subdued harmonies of the St. Regis
Roof. Randy was, as Peggy had suspected, a fine
dancer. His lightness and his certainty helped her,
and she knew that she had never danced so well
before. But even as they floated about the gleaming
floor, the sounds of the elegant music could not
quite drown out the tinny jazz sound of Fourteenth
Street that echoed in her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>No, she thought, Randy had not been altogether
right. This beautiful room, these handsome, well-dressed
people were not nearly so real as the world
outside. And it was that world, in which she would
start her search tomorrow, that stayed uppermost in
her thoughts through the rest of the dreamlike night
with its dancing, its carriage ride around the park
and (or was this too a dream?) Randy&rsquo;s gentle
good-night kiss on the steps of the Gramercy Arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Hidden City</i></span></h2>
<p>When the list was completed, Peggy had found
over forty theaters built since 1890 and not currently
listed as theaters in the classified phone book.
Now there was nothing to do except visit each one to
see if it was still there at all, and if there, to see what
it was being used for. Checking the addresses
against her city map and street-number guide, Peggy
listed those that she would visit first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started out with a group I think we can cover
in one afternoon,&rdquo; she explained to Amy. &ldquo;And the
district I&rsquo;ve picked is not too far away from most
of the off-Broadway theaters in Greenwich Village.
I&rsquo;d like it best if we could find a theater near where
people are used to going, or at least in districts that
are easy to get to by bus or subway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much about that,&rdquo; Greta commented
from the depths of an easy chair. &ldquo;If you
can just find a place to put on the play, and if the
play is good, people will come. Even if they have to
walk, or pay tremendous cab fares. That&rsquo;s one wonderful
thing about New York. People love the theater,
and they&rsquo;re willing to go through all kinds of
hardships to see a good play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;The proof of that is the prices people pay to see a
Broadway show,&rdquo; Amy agreed. &ldquo;Six and eight dollars
a seat for some of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s at box-office prices,&rdquo; Irene commented.
&ldquo;They pay twenty-five dollars to a ticket
broker sometimes to see a really popular show. I
think that the thing to be in this business is a broker,
not an actress. That&rsquo;s where the big money is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember that when we get our theater,&rdquo;
Peggy said, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put aside a whole lot of
seats in my name, and if the show&rsquo;s a hit I&rsquo;ll make a
fortune on them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No theater, no tickets,&rdquo; Amy said dryly. &ldquo;And no
show either. We&rsquo;d better get going now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The area that Peggy had decided to cover first
was a section south of Fourteenth Street, and somewhat
farther east than where they had been. This
was an old part of town, in which the theater had
once been centered even before it had moved &ldquo;uptown&rdquo;
to Fourteenth Street. (Fourteenth Street itself
is now very much downtown from the present theater
district in the west Forties and Fifties.)</p>
<p>This old district had seen wave after wave of immigrants
come from various lands. Each nation had
left its mark. There were Russian stores, Rumanian
restaurants, Irish bars, Jewish delicatessens, Italian
grocery stores, and Spanish shops of all sorts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like looking at a cross section of certain kinds
of rocks,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;You know, the kinds that give
you a million-year history of the earth and the kinds
of life that have come and gone. Finding all these
traces of different languages and peoples is sort of
like geology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Amy agreed, &ldquo;and you can tell pretty well
which groups came to the neighborhood first and
which ones followed, and which are the latest. I&rsquo;d
say the Irish were first, and then the Rumanians and
the Russians, a lot of whom were Jewish, and finally
the Puerto Ricans. Look at that store!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to an old building with store windows
lettered &ldquo;<i>Carnecer&iacute;a</i>,&rdquo; which is Spanish for
&ldquo;butcher shop.&rdquo; Over the windows was a faded old
signboard which the present tenants had neglected
to remove. Its gilt letters, nearly illegible, read,
&ldquo;A. Y. Ravotsky, Inc.,&rdquo; and on either side of the lettering,
carved into the wood, was an Irish shamrock
and harp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a one-stop history of New York!&rdquo; Peggy
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet if you dug underneath it you&rsquo;d find
Dutch shoes and Indian arrowheads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few blocks&rsquo; walk brought them to their first address.
There was no sign of a theater at all. In its
place was a large, squat hospital; on its cornerstone
appeared the date it was built&mdash;1912.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that takes care of Hewett&rsquo;s Theater,&rdquo; Peggy
said sadly, crossing off the name on her list. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s try the Emperor. It&rsquo;s only two blocks away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The Emperor Theater was now effectively disguised
as a Greek Orthodox church, complete with a
turnip-shaped steeple and a Russian signboard outside.
The next theater on the list was a large and
gaudy caterer&rsquo;s hall, used for weddings, parties, lodge
meetings, and dances, according to its poster. The
next two on the list had also totally disappeared, giving
way to a garage and an apartment house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is hardly encouraging,&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;I somehow
feel already that we&rsquo;re on a wild-goose chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy, this is no time to get discouraged!&rdquo; Peggy
said. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve only gone to five places, and we&rsquo;ve
got nearly forty more on the list! And, after all, it&rsquo;s
not as if we were looking for a dozen theaters. All
we want is one, so I don&rsquo;t care if all but one prove to
be shut or converted. And we have to see them all,
just in case it&rsquo;s the last one that turns out to be for
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes sense,&rdquo; Amy agreed, &ldquo;and I certainly
don&rsquo;t want to quit. It&rsquo;s just that I wish we
had hit it right the first time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lazy girl,&rdquo; Peggy reproached her. &ldquo;Do
you know the way I feel about it? Even if we had
found a good theater on our first call, I&rsquo;d still want
to see everything else on the list, just to make sure
that we had the best one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>After some more walking, in which they found
two more missing theaters and one that had been
converted to a funeral parlor, they decided to stop
for lunch in a delicatessen where sausages of every
shape and size hung like decorations from the ceiling.
They sat at a small table near open barrels of
pickles, pickled tomatoes, and sauerkraut and stuffed
themselves with corned-beef sandwiches on fresh,
fragrant rye bread dotted with caraway seeds, homemade
potato salad, cole slaw, and pickles. Afterward,
they felt much better, and more heartened for the
rest of the day&rsquo;s search.</p>
<p>As they worked their way downtown, the neighborhood
began to change once more, and the girls
were unable to guess what might be the nationality
of the dark, strong-faced people they now saw
about them. The signs on the windows didn&rsquo;t help
either, being in a language they could not identify.</p>
<p>It might have remained a mystery, had they not
been stopped by a policeman who said, &ldquo;What are
a couple of nice-looking girls like you doing in the
Gypsy section? This is no place to sight-see, you
know. I&rsquo;d advise you to take a guided tour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sight-seeing,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking
for an address&mdash;actually for an old theater.
Maybe you can help us. We want to find the Burke
Theater, if it still exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman was puzzled until Peggy showed
him the address, and then he smiled broadly. &ldquo;Well,
you might just as well forget it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It might
have been a theater once, but not any longer. The
Settlement House has it now, and it&rsquo;s the local
boys&rsquo; club, complete with a gymnasium equipped
for every sport. It&rsquo;s done a lot of good in this neighborhood,
I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Peggy and Amy thanked him, and then asked him
about the Gypsies. They hadn&rsquo;t realized there were
any in the city&mdash;or at least not enough to make up a
whole district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a large district,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No more than a
thousand or so, at the most. At least that&rsquo;s what they
say, but it&rsquo;s not easy getting them to hold still to be
counted. They&rsquo;re good people, once you get to know
them. Only they speak a language nobody can understand,
and their ways are different. If I were you,
I wouldn&rsquo;t hang around here much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking him, the girls left, not without casting a
few glances back over their shoulders until they were
sure they were clear of the area.</p>
<p>The remaining theaters on their first day&rsquo;s list were
to the west of the Gypsy district, and these too
proved to offer nothing. The district they now found
themselves in was on the outskirts of Chinatown, and
was half Chinese and half mixed-New-York. Of the
theaters on the list for this part of town, one had
been at one time a Chinese movie house, and was
now a Rescue Mission. Signboards in rusty black
with large white lettering warned sinners to repent,
and offered soup and bread to anyone who attended
the services. From inside, the girls heard some
wheezy voices and an even wheezier organ sounding
the plaintive notes of a hymn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Peggy realized with a start that this was the Bowery,
the sinister, pathetic district inhabited by the
poorest examples of humanity&mdash;those who had almost
resigned from the human race. Looking about
her, she saw tattered men in doorways, sleeping figures
huddled under stairs, groups of tough-looking
tramps standing idly on street corners. She was suddenly
aware that she and Amy were the only women
in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy,&rdquo; she said in a shaky voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we
shouldn&rsquo;t have come here! This is the Bowery, and
you remember what the guide said about it when
we took that bus trip. He called it the worst district
of the city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; Amy whispered, looking nervously
about her. &ldquo;What should we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;Chinatown
starts right across the street, and I remember what
the guide said about that, too. He said not to believe
all the old mystery stories; Chinatown is just about
the safest place in the city. The Chinese have practically
no criminals among them, and any tourist is
safe there. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trying to look as inconspicuous as possible, and
doing all they could to avoid the appearance of
hurrying, Peggy and Amy crossed the street and
turned into a narrow alley between two Chinese
food shops whose windows were filled with things
that neither girl could identify.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Once more they were made aware of the sudden
changeability of the city. In no time at all, they were
out of the frightening streets of the Bowery and in
the crowded, noisy, bright-colored center of Chinatown.
The streets, so narrow that in some places the
sidewalks were scarcely a foot wide, were lined with
restaurants, gift shops, importing houses that specialized
in tea and spices, and more of the oddly
stocked Oriental groceries and markets. Somewhat
shaken by their fear on the Bowery, they stopped for
tea and rice cookies in a large Chinese restaurant,
where they sat at a small table on a balcony overhanging
the main street of the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better stop looking for theaters today,&rdquo;
Peggy suggested. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s after five-thirty
now, and almost time for dinner. Why don&rsquo;t we look
around some of the shops here, and then come back
to this restaurant for dinner? We can look for theaters
again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy agreed, but looked pained at the suggestion
that they do more searching the next day. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how you can stand it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My feet are
killing me from today&rsquo;s walk. Why don&rsquo;t we wait
awhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because tomorrow&rsquo;s Sunday,&rdquo; Peggy replied
firmly, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s our last chance to get in a full day&rsquo;s
looking before next week. After-school hours just
aren&rsquo;t enough. If we really want to check out this
whole list, we have to work weekends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy sighed. &ldquo;My worst habit isn&rsquo;t laziness,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s picking the wrong kind of friends. If I had
known, when we first met, how much energy you
have, I would have refused to know you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Hidden Theater</i></span></h2>
<p>Sunday, like Saturday, produced one blank after another.</p>
<p>Peggy and Amy saw theaters that had been turned
into television studios, union halls, social clubs, and
lodges; theaters converted to restaurants and supermarkets;
sites of theaters long vanished and forgotten
now occupied by office buildings, apartment houses
or the blank-faced, featureless warehouses that fill
much of lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>On Monday, when their last class was over at two-thirty,
Peggy once more took up her list and her
bundle of city maps and guides. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Amy,&rdquo; she
said in tones of mixed determination and resignation.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a couple of hours this afternoon, and we
might as well use them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we take the afternoon off?&rdquo; Amy
asked. &ldquo;My feet are just killing me, and I&rsquo;m sure if I
walk for another two hours I&rsquo;ll come down with an
awful blister. We can look again tomorrow, after a
day&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Peggy considered the suggestion for a moment. It
would be a relief to take an afternoon off and just
loaf about the house. But then she shook her head.
&ldquo;No. If we don&rsquo;t have any luck, we can take tomorrow
off, but I&rsquo;d like to go out again today. There&rsquo;s a
meeting of the players tonight at Connie&rsquo;s, you know,
and I&rsquo;d love to be able to report that we found
something today. Let&rsquo;s give it a try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Peggy,&rdquo; Amy agreed, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re game,
so am I. And it would be nice to have some good
news for the gang tonight. I&rsquo;m just afraid that we&rsquo;ll
put a damper on the evening when we show up all
tired out with some more of our usual bad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy half agreed, but knew that if she gave in
and let down her pace, she might never again get
up the kind of drive she had been working on for the
last week. With a deep breath and a determined expression,
she swept Amy off with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The section we&rsquo;re looking in today,&rdquo; she explained
as they walked to the subway, &ldquo;is a little
west and south of Greenwich Village. It&rsquo;s mostly
warehouses now, but there were once several theaters
there, and since there&rsquo;s been almost no new construction
in the area in the last fifty years, there&rsquo;s a
chance that some of the theaters have been left
alone. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in two of them that
I think have a better chance of being there than the
others we&rsquo;ve looked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should these two have a better chance?&rdquo;
Amy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;The licenses show that there were several theaters
built in the city at one time in a way that got around
the fire laws. The law said that you couldn&rsquo;t build a
theater with any other kind of space over it, and with
land so expensive, it kept a lot of people from building
theaters. So a few smart builders put theaters on
the top floors of office buildings, and got more rentable
space on their ground that way. I&rsquo;ve found permits
for over a dozen of these top-floor theaters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should they still be there,&rdquo; Amy asked,
&ldquo;any more than any of the other old theaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two reasons,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;In the first
place, nobody would want to convert a top-floor theater
to a restaurant or a garage or anything like that.
And in the second place, the district we&rsquo;re going to
has practically no apartment buildings in it, and that
means that there aren&rsquo;t residents in the neighborhood
to want to use a theater for a social club or a church or
a funeral parlor. I have a feeling that we&rsquo;re going to
find our theater here, if we find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy agreed with Peggy&rsquo;s logic and further noted
that, if they did find a theater in this district, it
would be a good location. There were two subway
lines that had stops on either side of the area, and
several bus lines as well.</p>
<p>These observations gave them a somewhat more
cheerful outlook, and it was with a renewed sense of
anticipation that they came up from the subway
and started their search in this promising new district.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The streets in this part of town were narrow, and
crowded with trucks that were backed up at all angles
to loading platforms that ran like boardwalks
along the fronts of the buildings. Most of the buildings
were produce markets where wholesale food
merchants received the meats, vegetables, fruits, and
packaged goods that fed the city. Wide protective
canopies that overhung their fronts gave the loading
platforms the appearance of old-fashioned porches.
Other buildings were warehouses, obviously designed
for storage. Their blank windowless walls and
heavy steel doors made them look like ancient fortresses.
Here and there, between these and the produce
markets, stood the most familiar kind of New
York business building, the so-called &ldquo;loft,&rdquo; used
for light industry or, occasionally, offices. It was in
front of one of these that Peggy stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our first address,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;According to
my list, a theater was licensed here by the original
construction permit in 1892.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy looked at the worn, red brick front, unconvinced.
&ldquo;A theater here? I can&rsquo;t imagine it! Maybe
this place was built later, after the original building
with the theater was torn down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy shook her head. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ve
gotten pretty good at architecture in the last few
days, and I think I can guess the date of a New
York building within a couple of years. This wasn&rsquo;t
built much later than 1892. It must be the original
building with the theater. Let&rsquo;s see if we can get any
clue to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The girls walked across the street in order to get a
better view of the building and, as soon as they
turned to look, Peggy&rsquo;s eyes lighted. &ldquo;Look up!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a theater up there, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Amy asked wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the windows! The first five floors have
windows all the same height&mdash;a normal ceiling
height. But the top floor has windows that must
be twenty feet high! That means that the ceiling
height is over twenty feet up there. What else could
it be but the theater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be right!&rdquo; Amy agreed with excitement.
&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s a janitor or anyone who can
tell us about it; if it&rsquo;s being used, and what for. Even
if someone&rsquo;s using it, we might be able to rent it
from him if we can pay him more than he&rsquo;s paying
now. Let&rsquo;s go and look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran across the street and into the vestibule of
the building, but when Peggy tried the door, she
found it locked. A small sign on the door read <span class="sc">O &amp; O
TRUCKING Co</span>. And the same name was written over
the bank of mailboxes. Apparently there were no
other tenants in the building, and nobody seemed to
be in the O &amp; O offices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can always write to them,&rdquo; Amy suggested,
&ldquo;or we can try them on the phone until we find someone
in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; Peggy agreed. But then
she noticed the doorbell, almost invisible under
many layers of thick green paint. &ldquo;Wait a minute!
Let&rsquo;s see if the bell works. Maybe there&rsquo;s a watchman,
or somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p7.jpg" alt="The door swung open" width="500" height="344" />
</div>
<p>A push at the button produced a loud ringing from
deep within the building. Its sound seemed to echo
for seconds after Peggy released the button.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anybody in there, that&rsquo;s going to bring
him,&rdquo; she said. After a few minutes&rsquo; wait, she decided
to try again. This time, at the same instant that
she touched the doorbell, the door swung open, revealing
a man in dirty overalls who stood blinking at
the light and regarding them with a scowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatta ya want?&rdquo; he grated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the superintendent?&rdquo; Peggy asked politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the janitor. Whatta ya wanta know for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re just wondering about the theater upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theater? Ain&rsquo;t no theater here, kid,&rdquo; the man
growled, and started to shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Peggy said, holding the door open.
&ldquo;There is a theater upstairs! We know there is! All
I want to know is what it&rsquo;s used for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t used for nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the janitor started
angrily. Then he stopped himself, remembering his
first statement. &ldquo;Besides, you got the wrong place.
Like I said, no theater here. Now beat it!&rdquo; With an
extra push, he slammed the door shut, and Peggy
and Amy once more were faced with nothing more
enlightening than the O &amp; O sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve never in my life seen such awful manners!&rdquo;
Amy said, almost with a stamp of her foot.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to that company as soon as we
get home and tell them about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy,&rdquo; Peggy interrupted, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re getting
excited about the wrong thing. Let&rsquo;s get away from
here and talk this over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before leaving the district, she crossed the
street once more to be sure that she was not mistaken
about the building. Her second look convinced
her that she had been right. Those windows could
only mean a high-ceilinged room of some sort, and
the license clearly stated that it had been a theater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Amy, there&rsquo;s just one thing to do now. We&rsquo;ve got
to check the city records again, this time to see the
plans of this building. Then, once we&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s a
theater, we&rsquo;ve got some thinking to do before we
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would that janitor say there was no theater
there if there is one?&rdquo; Amy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question,&rdquo; Peggy agreed darkly. &ldquo;I
want to know why he said that, and I want to know
what the place is being used for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Peggy,&rdquo; Amy protested, &ldquo;why should we go
poking into other people&rsquo;s business? We already
know that they&rsquo;re not going to rent us this theater,
and that they&rsquo;re downright unpleasant people. Why
don&rsquo;t we just cross this one off, and go look at the
others on your list?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy, you&rsquo;re not thinking clearly,&rdquo; Peggy said patiently.
&ldquo;It seems to me that the only reason anyone
would have for acting the way that janitor did is
that there&rsquo;s something wrong going on in there&mdash;something
that makes it important for them to keep
people out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Amy said reasonably, &ldquo;why
did the janitor act so suspiciously? If he had just
said that the theater&rsquo;s been converted to some other
use and isn&rsquo;t for rent, we would have gone away
and not thought a thing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Peggy agreed, &ldquo;but I think we
caught him off guard. After all, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly the
first time anyone&rsquo;s come around to ask him about
the theater, and he just didn&rsquo;t know what to say.
Besides, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s very smart. He&rsquo;s certainly
not the man in charge of whatever crooked
business is going on in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s something crooked, why don&rsquo;t
we just report it to the police?&rdquo; Amy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go to the police with just our suspicions,&rdquo;
Peggy replied. &ldquo;They want some kind of indication
that there&rsquo;s something illegal before they
can investigate. In fact, I know they can&rsquo;t even get
a search warrant without evidence. No, I&rsquo;m afraid
we&rsquo;ll have to look into this on our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Peggy,&rdquo; Amy protested, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re supposed to
be looking for a theater, not playing cops and robbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> looking for a theater,&rdquo; Peggy said intently.
&ldquo;If we uncover something crooked going on
in there, and if we can convince the police of it,
that building&rsquo;s going to be vacant pretty soon. Come
on! Let&rsquo;s dig up the plans for this place before the
Bureau closes for the night! I want to see what
kind of stage the group is going to have to play on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Stage Door</i></span></h2>
<p>This time, knowing the name and address of the theater,
and knowing exactly what they were looking
for, the girls had little trouble finding the file set of
plans for the theater, kept with the Fire Department
as a record of the seating plan, capacity, and exits.</p>
<p>Mason&rsquo;s Starlight Theater, as the place had originally
been called, had a good working stage plan,
not too wide, but with extraordinarily good depth. It
accommodated four hundred seats, which was a
small auditorium by Broadway standards, but larger
than most of the off-Broadway houses. Wing and fly
space was generous, to allow for easy movement
of scenery off to the sides (or wings) or up on ropes
and pulleys to the flies. The dressing rooms were
small, but they were well located. It seemed to Amy
and Peggy like the perfect jewelbox of a theater that
they had dreamed of since they had started their
search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The entrance to the theater, they found, was not
through the street door of the loft building, but down
an L-shaped alley that ran alongside the building
and, when it turned, opened into a sort of courtyard.
Playgoers had been taken up to the top floor on an
oversized freight elevator which also had served for
bringing in scenery and props, and which was rated
to carry fifty passengers at once. Two additional exits
were provided by fire-escapes outside the building.
There was no way to enter or leave the theater from
the rest of the building, and the elevator stopped only
at the theater level. The loft floors were served by a
regular-sized passenger elevator reached through
the front hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks just perfect,&rdquo; Peggy said triumphantly.
&ldquo;Now all we have to do is find out what
it&rsquo;s being used for, expose it, and move in when
the crooks move out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re jumping to conclusions,&rdquo; Amy said.
&ldquo;It seems to me that the janitor might actually not
have known about the theater. After all, it can&rsquo;t be
reached through the building, and if he&rsquo;s never
been told about the back elevator, or never been allowed
to use it, he might not know what&rsquo;s up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Peggy said doubtfully, &ldquo;but it seemed
to me that he looked awfully guilty about something.
I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s part of whatever&rsquo;s going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy protested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point! Maybe
there&rsquo;s nothing going on there! Maybe the janitor
doesn&rsquo;t know about the theater, and it&rsquo;s not being
used by crooks, but just sitting up there empty, gathering
dust! Wouldn&rsquo;t that be wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure would,&rdquo; Peggy agreed, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
we&rsquo;re that lucky. Of course we could look up the
name of the owner of the building and ask him about
the theater, but if it is a crooked game, and if the
owner is in on it.... No. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the
way to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you think we should handle it, then?&rdquo;
Amy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to go back to the place right
now,&rdquo; Peggy said, &ldquo;before it gets dark. I want to
look around that back alley and theater entrance
just to see if we can pick up any clues. Then we&rsquo;ll
talk it over with the boys and listen to their ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe that you&rsquo;ll talk it over with them,&rdquo;
Amy laughed, &ldquo;but I have my doubts about your
listening to anybody&rsquo;s ideas! Still, I said I&rsquo;d go theater
hunting with you, and I&rsquo;m not going to back
out now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had turned in their plans and
charts to the file clerk and returned to the loft-theater
building, it was almost six o&rsquo;clock. Most of the
trucks that had filled the streets were gone now, not
to return until after midnight, when the produce
market would open for one more business &ldquo;day.&rdquo; A
few of the offices, small manufacturing businesses
and printing shops that filled the surrounding lofts,
were still open, judging by the lights in their windows,
but for the most part the streets and buildings
were empty in the pearly twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Making every effort to be inconspicuous, the girls
ducked down the alley to the rear courtyard entrance
of the Starlight Theater. A miniature marquee
bearing the name &ldquo;Mason&rsquo;s&rdquo; overhung a short flight
of stairs that led up to a loading platform, at the
back of which was a wide, high elevator door
with pillars on either side. Above it, a plaster arch
was decorated with the twin masks of Comus&mdash;comedy
and tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still think that the janitor didn&rsquo;t know
there was a theater in the building?&rdquo; Peggy whispered.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have had to be blind as well as dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking very quietly, the girls ascended the steps
and approached the huge elevator door. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
Peggy whispered, pointing to the metal doorsill. Amy
nodded, clearly understanding the meaning of the
bright metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s being used regularly,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;You can
see where the sill is dark and rusted toward the sides,
and bright in the center, where people have been
walking over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lock!&rdquo; Amy said. She and Peggy examined
the heavy padlock that secured the door to the
frame by stout hasps. It was bright and clean, of
modern design and well-oiled. Any further doubts
they might have had were dispelled by examination
of the door hinges, which were coated with a heavy
layer of fresh grease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only is the theater in use,&rdquo; Peggy whispered,
&ldquo;but whoever is using it is being awfully careful that
he doesn&rsquo;t make any noise opening and shutting
these doors. Are you convinced now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Amy nodded, wide-eyed. &ldquo;I surely am. And I&rsquo;m
convinced that we&rsquo;d better get out of here before the
man with the keys comes along! I&rsquo;d hate to be
caught snooping around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling not in the least as calm as she hoped she
looked, Peggy motioned Amy to wait while she took
a last look around to be sure that there was nothing
she had missed. Then, her heart beating wildly, she
and Amy left the alley as cautiously as they had entered
it. But neither of them felt really safe until
they were blocks away, and on their way to Connie&rsquo;s
for the meeting of the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be practically living in alleys,&rdquo; Amy
said as they let themselves in through the street gate
and started down the passage to Connie&rsquo;s little
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I feel a lot better in this one than in
the last,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;When we get the theater,
we&rsquo;ll have to fix up that alley like this one, with
flower borders and lights to make it cheerful. We
can fix up the courtyard, too, with a little fountain
and some garden seats and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully confident about getting that theater,&rdquo;
Amy interrupted. &ldquo;I hope that you&rsquo;re not going
to be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;I know that it was just
meant for us, and I mean to make sure that we get
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Connie let the girls in, and while they were saying
hello to her and the others, the buzzer announced
the arrival of Tom Galen and Mona Downs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad everyone&rsquo;s here at once!&rdquo; Peggy said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so full of news that if we had to wait for anyone,
I think we&rsquo;d burst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us you&rsquo;ve found a theater!&rdquo; Randy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; Peggy answered, &ldquo;because we
did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo; Mal asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; Connie said at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much is it?&rdquo; Randy put in, in the same
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa! One at a time!&rdquo; Peggy protested. &ldquo;If everybody
will get settled and hold the questions for a
few minutes, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Now,&rdquo; she said,
when the players were seated in expectant attitudes,
&ldquo;now I&rsquo;ll tell you everything you want to know. It&rsquo;s
called Mason&rsquo;s Starlight Theater; it&rsquo;s on the top floor
of a loft in the market area southwest of Greenwich
Village; we don&rsquo;t know the rent; it&rsquo;s a perfect theater,
just the right size, and&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel a <i>but</i> coming, rather than an <i>and</i>,&rdquo; Randy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only a small <i>but</i>,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;The place
happens to be in use right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Mal said sarcastically. &ldquo;You can now add
your name to the long list of those among us who
have located perfect theaters that happen to be in
use!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;This is different. In the first
place, nobody will admit to using it; in the second
place, we think there&rsquo;s something crooked going on
there; and if we do a little bit of detective work, I
think we can find out what it is. If I&rsquo;m right, and if
it&rsquo;s being used by crooks, we can get the theater for
ourselves by getting the crooks out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their interest aroused by this unusual statement,
the players began to question Peggy and Amy about
their suspicions and about the circumstances that
surrounded their discovery of the Starlight Theater.
When the girls had told them about their interview
with the janitor, and about their later visit to the alley
behind the building, everyone seemed convinced
that there was something peculiar going on at the
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The polished doorsill and the greased hinges and
the new lock prove that it&rsquo;s being used,&rdquo; Peggy concluded.
&ldquo;And the janitor&rsquo;s attitude seems to indicate
that it&rsquo;s being used for something illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like an airtight case to me,&rdquo; Pip said.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just take the facts to the police and
let them investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are no facts yet,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;All
we have are guesses. There must be thousands of
places in use in the city, and thousands of janitors
who don&rsquo;t want to be friendly and tell what they&rsquo;re
used for, and I don&rsquo;t think that the police would be
willing to agree that they&rsquo;re all run by gangsters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy&rsquo;s right. We can&rsquo;t go to the police without
more evidence,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;Before they&rsquo;ll swear
out a search warrant, we have to have something
more definite for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get it!&rdquo; Pip said with enthusiasm. &ldquo;What
do you suggest, Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to set up a lookout post in that
back alley,&rdquo; she answered decisively. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place
under the fire stairs on the far side of the building
where two people could hide and see without being
seen, and it shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple of
nights of looking to find out what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why nights?&rdquo; Randy asked. &ldquo;They might be doing
whatever it is they do in the daytime, too. I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;d have to set up a twenty-four-hour watch
to be sure of finding anything out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Randy,&rdquo; Peggy argued. &ldquo;If they
were using the place by day, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t
have taken so much care with the hinges. What&rsquo;s
more, I&rsquo;m sure the janitor was sleeping when we rang
the bell, which is why he took so long in answering
it. I would guess that he works at night with the rest
of the gang. Besides, that neighborhood would be
perfect for night work. The markets are practically
deserted between six and midnight. Probably after
midnight, when the markets open up, the crooks run
a legitimate trucking business as a cover-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s a positive Sherlock,&rdquo; Mal said fondly.
&ldquo;Anyway, we can try a few nights, and if nothing
shows up, we can then worry about extending the
watch during the daytime as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Tom Galen asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to start
tonight. We&rsquo;d want to be in the alley and under the
stairs before it gets really dark. Tomorrow Amy and I
will stand watch, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;You two have
done your part in this. The lookout work will be done
by men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; Peggy said, outwardly
reluctant to give in, but secretly happy that she
wouldn&rsquo;t have to spend nights crouching under those
dark stairs and waiting for heaven only knew what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go tomorrow,&rdquo; Pip said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Tom Galen said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
go two at a time, at least for the purpose of having
two witnesses to anything we see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Randy and I will go the next night,&rdquo; Mal
said. &ldquo;We can alternate from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything arranged, Mal tried to turn the group
to the original purpose of the meeting, which was to
work on further readings of the play. He soon
realized that everyone was too keyed up to concentrate,
and canceled work for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, in fact, that we&rsquo;d better forget about
rehearsals entirely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at least until we have
this theater business settled one way or the other.
For one thing, we&rsquo;re going to need all the sleep we
can get on the nights that we&rsquo;re not standing watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone agreed, and in varying states of tension
and excitement, said good night and parted, knowing
that the next few days might be very, very busy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Understudies for Danger</i></span></h2>
<p>School the next day seemed almost unreal to Peggy.
Or was it the dark alley and the night watch to come
that was the unreal thing? Considered carefully,
nothing seemed quite real, even her home and her
parents in the neat, orderly world of Rockport. A ride
on Socks around the autumn fields of Wisconsin would
clear her mind, she thought, or just an hour alone in
her favorite thinking spot in the harness room.</p>
<p>Her thoughts, shuttling restlessly between the
friendly barn and the now-sinister alley, were definitely
not on her work, which was a lecture session on
television acting technique.</p>
<p>At lunch in the park, the discussion centered on
the night&rsquo;s work that waited for Pip and Tom Galen.
It all seemed very melodramatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged with Tom,&rdquo; Pip was saying, &ldquo;to
meet me downtown a little before six. We&rsquo;re both
going to wear black slacks and sweaters, and we&rsquo;ll
take black gloves. That way, we ought to melt into
the shadows perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about your faces?&rdquo; Connie giggled. &ldquo;Are you
going to go in blackface like a couple of Al Jolsons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We considered it,&rdquo; Pip said seriously, &ldquo;but we decided
that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary. If anyone comes, we&rsquo;ll
hold our gloved hands over our faces, and look
through our fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say you&rsquo;ve thought of everything,&rdquo; Amy
said in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; Pip echoed gloomily, &ldquo;except what
to do if we get caught. We even worked out something
about that, but I don&rsquo;t know how good it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you worked out?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to call Randy at one in the morning
to tell him that we&rsquo;re going off duty. If we don&rsquo;t
call by then, he&rsquo;s supposed to call the police. Tomorrow
night, he and Mal will call me at one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds sensible,&rdquo; Peggy commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Sensible. But if they catch us, say, at ten
o&rsquo;clock, we could be in some pretty bad trouble by
the time the police come around after one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that this line of conversation was doing
them no good at all, Peggy tried, with little success,
to change the subject. By the time lunch was over
and they had returned to the Academy, all four of
them felt thoroughly depressed.</p>
<p>Somehow, Peggy got through the afternoon.</p>
<p>And somehow, she got through the night, but it
was scarcely a restful one. She lay awake until one
o&rsquo;clock worrying about Pip and Tom, and finally, at
one-fifteen, called Randy. He answered at the first
ring, quite awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they call?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one o&rsquo;clock sharp,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t seen anything at all, and they&rsquo;re perfectly
all right. Now get some sleep. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling relieved, Peggy went back to bed, but it
was not easy to sleep. What had seemed such a good
idea yesterday was beginning to seem foolish today.
The boys were engaging in unknown risks, and nobody
knew what dangers they might encounter. Perhaps
they should have gone to the police in the first
place, and tried to convince them that something was
amiss. Perhaps they should still do so....</p>
<p>Finally, she slept, troubled by vague, unpleasant
dreams.</p>
<p>The next day, her doubts grew stronger. Pip appeared
at school late, looking like a molting owl.
He had rings under his eyes and seemed not to have
slept at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided to stay on until daylight,&rdquo; he explained
wanly, &ldquo;just in case your idea that any action
would take place between six and twelve was wrong.
Nothing happened, and we left at five-thirty in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Pip!&rdquo; Peggy protested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a twelve-hour
watch! You shouldn&rsquo;t be in school today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he assured her with a weak smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rested. Slept from six until nearly nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tackled his work gamely, but by noon agreed
with Peggy that the wisest course would be to cut
school for the afternoon and go home to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she cautioned him, &ldquo;you have to set
your alarm clock for one in the morning, in case you
don&rsquo;t get a call from Randy and Mal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do better than that,&rdquo; Pip said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to shut off the bell on my telephone so I can
sleep straight through to midnight. Then I&rsquo;ll have
the alarm wake me, so I can turn the phone on, and
I&rsquo;ll set the alarm for one o&rsquo;clock then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pip left, somewhat unsteadily, and Peggy went to
her afternoon class on Elizabethan drama. She forced
herself to concentrate, knowing that she would have
more than enough time that night to worry about the
mystery of the alley, and to speculate on what
troubles the second night watch might bring.</p>
<p class="tb">It was five-thirty and teatime at the Gramercy
Arms when the troubles began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your redheaded boy friend&rsquo;s on the phone for
you, Peggy,&rdquo; Greta announced from the head of the
stairs. &ldquo;He sounds worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly putting down her teacup, Peggy ran
from the kitchen and up to the phone in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Randy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Peggy,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nothing serious,
but I&rsquo;m afraid that Mal and I are going to be
hopelessly late for our watch tonight, and unless you
want to take a chance on missing whatever action
might take place in the alley, Pip and Tom are going
to have to cover it again. At least for the first few
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my car,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I had to go out to my
family&rsquo;s place on Long Island to get some stuff, and
Mal came along for the ride. We thought we&rsquo;d have
plenty of time, but on the way back, the car broke
down. We&rsquo;re in the middle of nowhere, and the
trouble will take at least another hour to fix. That
means that we couldn&rsquo;t possibly be at the alley until
about seven-thirty, and, to tell the truth, eight or
nine would be more like it. Will you get hold of Pip
and Tom and tell them the sad news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy agreed, wished him good luck with the car,
and hung up.</p>
<p>Pip&rsquo;s phone didn&rsquo;t answer, and after ringing for several
minutes, Peggy remembered his decision to shut off
the bell until midnight. She next tried the midtown hotel
where Tom Galen lived, but he was not in his room,
and the desk clerk had not seen him for several hours.</p>
<p>Hurrying downstairs to the kitchen and her now
cold cup of tea, she broke the news to Amy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe nothing will happen before eight or
nine,&rdquo; Amy said hopefully, but not looking too convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that if anything is going to happen,
that&rsquo;s just about the time for it,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;The
neighborhood doesn&rsquo;t really empty out until after six,
and it starts to get busy again a little before midnight.
If I wanted to do any work in that alley, I
think I&rsquo;d plan to arrive by eight and leave by ten, if
it could be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing happened last night,&rdquo; Amy said, &ldquo;so
maybe nothing will happen tonight either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to disagree again. Just because
nothing happened last night, I think that we stand a
better chance of seeing something tonight. Judging
from the used condition of that doorsill, whoever&rsquo;s using
the place doesn&rsquo;t let too much time go by between
visits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do about it?&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;With
Randy and Mal out on Long Island, and Pip and
Tom unreachable, that leaves only us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Peggy said firmly. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s going
to go tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peggy! Do you think we ought to?&rdquo; Amy
asked. &ldquo;I mean, it might be dangerous, and we are
a couple of girls, and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to play the feminine Southern
belle,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;We have to go. And besides,
there&rsquo;s no danger. It&rsquo;s not as if we&rsquo;ll be seen, or as if
we meant to rush out and stop the crooks if we see
them! We&rsquo;ll just hide under the stairs and watch.
Anyway, even if you don&rsquo;t want to go, you can&rsquo;t stop
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; Amy said with conviction.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to go to that place alone. When do
we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now!&rdquo; Peggy said eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost six
o&rsquo;clock, and we haven&rsquo;t got too much time to get
there before it&rsquo;s dark. Come on! We have to get
dressed for the occasion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Backstage Fright</i></span></h2>
<p>Peggy giggled uneasily as she and Amy inspected
themselves in the hall mirror before leaving the
Gramercy Arms. &ldquo;We look like a couple of character
actors dressed up for a skit on the Beat Generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or like a couple of weird vampires from a horror
movie,&rdquo; Amy replied with a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>Greta surveyed them critically. &ldquo;At least you don&rsquo;t
have to worry about anything,&rdquo; she said acidly.
&ldquo;Those getups would frighten off any man in the
world. If the crooks do catch sight of you, all it&rsquo;ll take
is one look before they scream and run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls were dressed identically, having taken
their cue from Pip in the matter of appropriate
clothes for playing detective in a dark alley. They
wore black skirts and sweaters, black stockings and
black shoes. They carried black gloves and black
scarves. The scarf was necessary for Amy to cover her
bright, blond hair, and Peggy thought it was a good
idea for her to take one, too, as a face covering. Neither
wore any jewelry at all, so there would be nothing
to rattle or jingle or catch the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not back by morning,&rdquo; Peggy said wryly,
&ldquo;send out the bloodhounds for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting up for you,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;re
not back by one-thirty, the first bloodhound to pick
up your trail is going to be me. With an appropriate
police escort,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Peggy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right.
Just wish us luck, and we&rsquo;ll be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. Good luck,&rdquo; Greta said, opening
the door for them. &ldquo;I just hope the police don&rsquo;t pick
you up, for looking like suspicious characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Amy left, feeling a little foolish about
their costumes, but after walking for a block or two,
they realized that nobody was even looking at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the wonderful thing about New York,&rdquo;
Peggy said. &ldquo;You can wear anything, or do anything,
and nobody seems to care as long as you don&rsquo;t
disturb the peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy nodded in agreement. &ldquo;The other day I noticed
a man with a beard down to his waist. He was
wearing a long Biblical-looking white robe and a pair
of sandals, and nobody on the street was paying the
least bit of attention to him. Just try to picture him
passing unnoticed in Pine Hollow or in Rockport!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just try to picture us passing unnoticed in Pine
Hollow or in Rockport!&rdquo; Peggy laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d probably
have a crowd of people and barking dogs and
small boys throwing stones by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver scarcely glanced at them as they
boarded a bus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s nice to know that nobody bothers
about you in New York,&rdquo; Peggy said when they were
seated, &ldquo;but in a way it&rsquo;s kind of scary. I mean, supposing
something were to happen to us, do you think
that anyone would even notice it if we screamed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy shivered. &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I suppose a lot of people would notice it, and then
they&rsquo;d just put it out of their minds and do nothing
about it. They&rsquo;d just figure it was none of their business,
after all, and go right on doing what they were
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was not a happy one, and both girls
lapsed into a tense silence as the bus bore them
downtown into the deepening twilight.</p>
<p>They got off in a district of office buildings, shops,
and showrooms, all dark now. The streets were
empty, save for an occasional car or taxi and the taillights
of their bus, receding in the distance. As they
turned to the west, down a narrow side street, the
street lights came on. They seemed to accentuate
the darkness rather than relieve it. The girls hurried
on past closed doors and shuttered windows. Each
block they walked brought them past older and lower
buildings. The smell of the river was brought to them
by an incoming mist. Somewhere in the distance
a foghorn sounded two short, mournful blasts and
then was still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>They were in the market and warehouse district
now. Parked trucks stood silently by darkened loading
docks, and shadows crouched behind tall stacks
of crates and boxes. One shadow suddenly detached
itself from the rest and shot by them with a wail!
Peggy&rsquo;s heart leaped and she clutched Amy&rsquo;s arm before
she realized it was only an alley cat.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8.jpg" alt="One shadow suddenly detached itself from the rest" width="500" height="722" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her voice trembling in
mixed fear and relief. &ldquo;Just a cat! Oh dear, if I let
that sort of thing scare me, I&rsquo;m not going to be much
good tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I was frightened, too,&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;It was
so sudden! We&rsquo;ll probably see more of them here,
chasing the rats that must live around these food
markets. We&rsquo;d better get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the thought of rats did nothing to calm Peggy&rsquo;s
nerves, or Amy&rsquo;s either. What if, in the alley behind
the theater, rats should come? What if they
should come at the same time as the crooks? What
if, under the fire stairs, there should come a quiet
scratching...? Peggy wondered if she would be
able to keep her silence then.</p>
<p>But they were near the theater alley now, and
Peggy resolutely put her fear of rats out of her mind.
Let&rsquo;s just worry about one thing at a time, she told
herself. The street was deserted, as she had hoped it
would be, and they were able to slip into the alley
unobserved.</p>
<p>They walked cautiously, taking care with each
step. If there was any work going on in the alley now,
this would be no time to disturb it. Before turning the
corner into the back court, they paused and listened
for what seemed a very long time. Not a sound disturbed
the night. The immediate silence was so perfect
that they could hear, far in the distance, the
never-ending rumble and stir of the city, the growl
of subways and motors, the far-off drone of airplanes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>They turned into the empty courtyard, darted
noiselessly for the fire stairs and crouched in the
shadows, their hearts drumming loudly and the
blood roaring in their ears like the noise of the distant
subways.</p>
<p>It was some time before they felt calm enough to
take stock of their position. The fire stair was, as
Peggy had told the boys, a perfect place to hide.
Most of it mounted out of sight in an airshaft on the
side of the building opposite the entrance alley. Only
the last six steps came out into the court, having
turned the corner of the building at a landing. The
space below the landing made a cramped little lean-to,
protected by the steps themselves on one side and
by a latticework of metal on the other. The space was
open only in the rear, from which direction nobody
could approach them.</p>
<p>The steps themselves were steel, and the risers between
the steps were of the same metal grillwork as
that on the side. It was almost impossible for anyone
to see into the shadowed cubbyhole behind the grill,
but quite an easy matter for the girls to see out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re safe enough here,&rdquo; Peggy whispered,
tactfully restraining herself from adding, &ldquo;as long as
no rats come around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems safe,&rdquo; Amy agreed, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly
call it comfortable. It&rsquo;s too low to stand in, and
I hate the thought of sitting down on the dirt that&rsquo;s
collected here. There&rsquo;s a box out there in the courtyard.
Why don&rsquo;t we bring it in to sit on?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; Peggy answered. &ldquo;Someone may remember
having seen it there, and if it&rsquo;s missing, it
might give them the idea that somebody&rsquo;s been here.
And we don&rsquo;t want anyone to get ideas like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy agreed reluctantly with the sense of Peggy&rsquo;s
argument, and shifted her position. &ldquo;No wonder Pip
was so tired,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;A whole twelve hours
of crouching like this must be a terrible thing to go
through! We&rsquo;ve only been here for about fifteen minutes,
and I&rsquo;m beginning to get pins and needles already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next hour and a half, spent mostly in silence,
and in trying to get used to the cramped position
beneath the stairs, passed by with terrible slowness.
Every so often, the roar of a truck would be heard in
the street, and the girls would grow tense, waiting
for it to turn into the alley. But it always went by,
leaving an even deeper silence behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time for Randy and Mal to come,&rdquo;
Peggy whispered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy them their night, but
I&rsquo;ll sure be glad to get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will&mdash;quiet! I hear another truck,&rdquo; Amy said.</p>
<p>Quietly shifting into new positions of comparative
comfort, the girls held their breath and waited to
hear the sound of the truck passing the alley. But this
one didn&rsquo;t pass.</p>
<p>A bright beam of headlights swept down the alley
and lighted up the court as the truck turned in off
the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those headlights!&rdquo; Peggy whispered. &ldquo;When they
turn the corner into the court, they&rsquo;re bound to light
up this whole stairway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hope the driver doesn&rsquo;t look this way!&rdquo; Amy
whispered in return.</p>
<p>But before the truck came into sight, the headlights
were switched off, and the driver came in under
the soft glow of the parking lamps. The truck was
an ordinary-looking, box-body affair, a little shabby,
dented, and in need of both a washing and a paint
job. Faded, once-gold letters high up on its side read
&ldquo;<span class="sc">O &amp; O TRUCKING Co.</span>&rdquo; The forlorn appearance of the
truck was belied by the soft, powerful sound of
its well-tuned engine as it turned into the alley and
was expertly backed up to the loading platform.</p>
<p>Two men silently leaped out of the cab and carefully
closed the doors. Moving on rubber-soled shoes,
they climbed onto the platform, unlocked the rear
doors of the truck and swung them back. A third
man, holding a rifle in his hand, stepped out of the
truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You get the stuff out, and
I&rsquo;ll keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped lightly down and stationed himself at
the corner by the alley, his rifle held ready, while the
other men unlocked the elevator doors and opened
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>They worked swiftly and quietly in the darkness,
which was relieved only by a very dim work light
mounted in the truck body. By its pale glow, Peggy
and Amy saw only an anonymous series of boxes being
transferred from the truck to the elevator. There
was no way to tell what they held but, Peggy thought,
it couldn&rsquo;t have been anything legal&mdash;not if it had
to be loaded secretly at night and under an armed
guard.</p>
<p>Thinking of the armed guard, she suddenly shivered
with fright as a new thought came to her. The
boys! Randy and Mal! What if they should choose
this moment to make their appearance? The man
with the rifle stood motionless and poised for action.
Peggy was sure he would not hesitate to shoot anyone
who walked into that alley. Biting her lip and
holding tightly to the steel support of the stair, she
prayed that Randy&rsquo;s engine would give him more
trouble, or that they would run into heavy traffic or
want to stop for dinner or ... or anything! Anything
to keep them from coming here until the truckmen
had finished their business and gone.</p>
<p>At least she was not kept long in suspense. The
men were quick and efficient, and their cargo was
not a very large one. In a very few minutes, the elevator
was loaded and, with a smooth whir not at all
like the Academy elevators, it ascended to the theater.
It returned not long after, emptied of its crates,
and the workmen shut off the mechanism, swung the
doors closed, and clicked the lock on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The watchman with the rifle nodded his approval,
climbed back into the rear of the truck and once
more allowed himself to be locked in. Without a
word, the truckmen took their places in the cab,
soundlessly shut the doors, and the battered truck
swung smoothly into the courtyard, backed up, and
turned down the alley.</p>
<p>It seemed like the first time in ten minutes that
Peggy had breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened to death that the boys would
come!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I could think of, too,&rdquo; Amy whispered
in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all I want is for them to come fast!&rdquo; Peggy
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got all the evidence we need for the
police, I think, and I just want to get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do get this theater for our play,&rdquo; Amy said,
&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll feel good about it. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll
never feel quite right about this place after tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll make it all over,&rdquo; Peggy said with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put bright lights in the little marquee,
and we&rsquo;ll put up lighted theater posters on the
walls, and I think we could paint the wall behind the
loading platform white with gilt trim on the pillars
on each side of the elevator. Then, if we can find a
fountain for the court, the way I suggested before,
and maybe a few stone benches, we&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; She
gave a start of fright as a male voice laughed close
to her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like a woman!&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;Supposed to be
keeping a lookout, and you&rsquo;re decorating an alley!
But where are Pip and Tom? And what are you doing
here? And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you everything over coffee,&rdquo; Peggy said.
&ldquo;Oh, Randy! It&rsquo;s all over! We&rsquo;ve got our crooks&mdash;and
they&rsquo;re crooks all right&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got our theater,
I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;and I&rsquo;m so glad you didn&rsquo;t come ten minutes
earlier, and.... Oh, let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mal said. &ldquo;This is hardly my idea of a
place for a date! Amy, take my arm. I have a feeling
you need it. And Randy, get a firm grip on Peggy, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop directing, Mal,&rdquo; Randy laughed. &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ve already written this scene quite nicely, and the
hero has the heroine well in hand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Forecast&mdash;Fair!</i></span></h2>
<p>Seated at the desk in her room, Peggy selected a
fresh sheet of paper. She was on the fifth page of a
letter to her friend Jean Wilson.</p>
<p class="tb">So you see I was right. There <i>were</i> crooks using
the theater all the time. The next day, Amy and I
told the police what we had seen in the alley, and
I think they were really pleased, even though they
did bawl us out for poking around in police affairs.
At that, they admitted that if we had come to
them the first time with nothing but suspicions,
they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do anything.
Anyway, they put a guard under the stairs
and stationed some more policemen around, and
two nights later they caught the gang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>It seems they were hijackers, which means that
they held up trucks on the road and stole valuable
cargo from them. They were using the theater as
a warehouse for the stolen goods until they could
dispose of them in whatever way crooks get rid of
stolen goods. When the police searched the place,
they found thousands and thousands of dollars&rsquo;
worth of furs and silverware and liquor and appliances
and all sorts of things. The cartons that
we saw them unload the night we were there
turned out to contain nylon stockings, and they
were worth about twenty thousand dollars, which
is an awful lot of nylon stockings.</p>
<p>The police say we&rsquo;re going to get a big reward
from the insurance people. The boys wanted to
give it all to me, but I refused it. I&rsquo;m going to
give it to the players&rsquo; group, which really means
to Randy and Mal, to rent the theater on a long-term
lease and to fix it up properly. They said
once before that they didn&rsquo;t want to be in the real
estate business, but I think that they&rsquo;re changing
their minds about that.</p>
<p>The police got in touch with the owner of the
building, who is retired and has been living in
Florida for a long time. He didn&rsquo;t know anything
about what was going on in the theater and was
quite grateful that we had gotten his crooked tenants
out of the place. It seems he has been so long
away from the New York real-estate scene, that he
didn&rsquo;t know his property was in demand as a
theater. He says it hasn&rsquo;t been used as one for over
fifty years! Of course, he could get more money
renting it as a theater than as a warehouse, but he
says he doesn&rsquo;t need more money, and we need a
theater. He has offered it to us on a ten-year lease
for the same rent he was getting before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Randy says that the rent is so low that even a
moderately successful season would give him and
Mal enough profit to live on comfortably, so
they&rsquo;re now beginning to talk about becoming
managers, doing their own shows and, when they
don&rsquo;t happen to have a show for a particular season,
renting the theater to other groups.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the rent covers the whole building,
and the boys are thinking of turning part of it into
apartments for themselves, and the rest of it into
apartments for other young actors, something like
a Gramercy Arms for boys!</p>
<p>Incidentally, the theater is beautiful. The police
let us in to take a look at it today, and even with
all those boxes and crates and fur coats and things
stacked around, we could see how nice it is. It&rsquo;ll
need new seats, I&rsquo;m afraid, and a new lighting
system and a switchboard and a curtain and loads
of other things, but the reward money will more
than cover all that. And we even have a name for
it&mdash;the Penthouse Theater. How does that strike
you? I only hope you can come to New York to
see it when it&rsquo;s all ready.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Or, better than that, plan to come to New York
next season when, with luck, I might have a part
in a play there. One of the things I like best about
Randy and Mal is that, even though they&rsquo;re just
bursting with gratitude and they keep calling me
a heroine, they haven&rsquo;t tried to &lsquo;pay me off&rsquo; by
offering me a part in the play. I&rsquo;m still going to
help just by painting scenery and selling ads in
the program and running errands and things like
that. This way, I know that if I ever get a part in
one of their plays, it will be because I deserve it as
an actress.</p>
<p>Another thing I like about Randy is that he&rsquo;s
coming to take me out again tonight. Which reminds
me&mdash;I&rsquo;d better sign off now, before Irene
and Amy install themselves in the bathrooms!</p>
<p>Do you suppose that&rsquo;s what they mean when
they say that one of the most important things
for an actress to learn is timing?</p>

<p>As far back as she can remember, Peggy Lane&mdash;young,
pretty, and talented&mdash;has wanted to become an actress.
Ambitious but realistic, Peggy knows her name isn&rsquo;t going
to be in lights immediately but finally persuades her cautious
parents to let her spend a year in New York to try
to gain a foothold in the fabled world of the theater.</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s first big test is an audition at the New York
Dramatic Academy, whose eccentric director will decide
whether she shows sufficient promise to be accepted for
professional training. Meanwhile, Peggy becomes friends
with Randy Brewster, a young playwright, and Mal
Seton, who will direct Randy&rsquo;s experimental play if and
when they can find an off-Broadway theater in which to
produce it. Peggy eagerly volunteers to help in their
desperate search and, exploring the byways of the city
for a forgotten theater, unwittingly stumbles into a mysterious
and dangerous situation.</p>
<p>The launching of Peggy&rsquo;s career, her struggle to make
her dreams become a reality, is a delightful and heart-warming
story.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
